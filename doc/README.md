### This is the course page template for WRA 210

1. Fork this repo (yes you should know what this means) to your own github account.
2. Clone your copy of this repo to your computer using the github desktop client (basically this tells github that everything in that folder of your computer belongs to this repo. This lets github know when the repo has been changed and when changes need to be committed and synced)
3. Rename this repo something cool and post the link in the course pages discussion area on the Google+ Community 
4. Edit the index.html file of this repo as the semester goes along.
5. Fix that heinous style.css file when we get to that part of the class.
6. Have fun! Lots of fun!
