Module 11</p>
	<p style="color:black">	The majority of my time was spent in my apartment, usually on the sofa with a glass of wine as I struggled to get things exactly where I wanted them. While I've played with HTML and CSS in the past, this was a learning experience for me. Most of the learning was achieved via trial, error, and then more wine. Google was my best friend, and if I could I would marry stackoverflow.
	<p style="color:black">I tended to rely on my scrum team, not as much when it came to HTML/CSS, but with the design of my site. They were extremely helpful when it came to getting their opinions, and not only that, but when they gave me compliments on all the work I'd done so far it really eased my nerves.
	<p style="color:black">I remember early on a member of my scrum team emailed us all for help. If I can remember correctly it was over an issue with Github, and while I knew how to solve the issue I know that my email was still kind of confusing. The next day in class I was able to show him how to fix the problem, which wasn't very hard at all, but sometimes it's just easier to show rather than to tell.
	<p style="color:black">Sadly I didn't spend my time in the workshops very effectively. I'm a rather shy person and the comfort of my own apartment and my own bedroom called to me. I did try my best, however, to make sure that my scrum team could come to me if they had any questions. Not that I'm amazing at this stuff, in fact the couple questions I did get asked I usually had to Google the solution.
	<p style="color:black">As mentioned earlier <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> was an amazing resource, and I used it more times than I'd like to admit. It was especially helpful when there were small issues, or little things that I didn't understand. Another great site was <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>. I never had to post any questions, apparently most of my problems were rather generic, or problems that others had come across in the past. What I did struggle with, however, was finding the right words to discover the answer. I realized pretty quickly that mixing up even one word, or picking the wrong when, when searching for help it could make the results completely different.
