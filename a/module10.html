	<p>I've allowed myself to get caught up in the aspects of the header. More specifically, I've been struggling with making the navigation within the header exactly how I want it. The reason I've been spending so much time and energy on attempting to make it perfect is because I want it good enough to be on all of the pages of my website in order to have a level of continuity. I know it might seem silly to have the same header on each page, but there's something I like about it. It seems, to me, that it will help make sure that nobody will get lost on my site and that they will be able to find all the important things no matter where they go.</p>

	<p>Currently, my CSS, HTML and Script is kind of messy.  I realize I need to sit down and just re-write and sort everything out so that I have a better understanding of it. The CSS in particular. Because I wanted drop down links I've been using the code from someone else's site in order to try to figure it all out.  In the end I want to change the design completely and make it my own, but for now I just wanted to see if I could even make it work so I copied and pasted their code. It sort of works, although things are a little off kilter on the page I was practicing on. So, like I said, I just need to sit down and re-code everything and get a better understanding as well as make it my own.</p>
	
	<p>I had originally wanted a sidebar on each side of the page, but they don't line up well with my header and I'm worried that even if I do line them up they'll look cheesy. So, I've been thinking about, at least for the right side, just putting my three (bubbles) is what I call them. I'll just put those on the right side and have them sort of floating over there (that's only for the landing page).  I think that will look nicer than having a side-bar over there cluttering things up.</p>
<p>	I want my content to stand out, and I believe it will stand out just fine because most of my content is PDF's. I plan on using something to put the PDFs on the seperate pages. I was actually thinking about having it so when you first pull up the page there's a description of the work on top of the work (instead of in a side-bar) and then you click something and it flips over to the PDF but I really think at my level that would be completely impossible to do so I'll probably just stick to the description in the side-bar.</p>
