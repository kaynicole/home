[1/30/2014 1:11:14 AM] Deano: I didn't watch the show as closely as I needed to to feel comfortable playing his character
[1/30/2014 1:11:34 AM] Deano: Like I've seen supernatural 1.5 billion times so I'm super close to dean
[1/30/2014 1:11:37 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: you should follow me on gabe and luci with dean
[1/30/2014 1:11:42 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: i'd love to play with him (cat)

[1/30/2014 1:12:28 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: if I were any of the characters who have the misfortune to meet him
[1/30/2014 1:12:50 AM] Deano: The only character that wouldn't shit his pants with luci is Michael l
[1/30/2014 1:12:53 AM] Deano: *lol
[1/30/2014 1:12:57 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao probably.
[1/30/2014 1:13:11 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: michael's the only one who can control him
[1/30/2014 1:13:13 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: to a degree
[1/30/2014 1:13:18 AM] Deano: Yepp
[1/30/2014 1:13:34 AM] Deano: Kali's still just like (tumbleweed)

[1/30/2014 1:13:45 AM] Deano: XD
[1/30/2014 1:13:49 AM] Deano: 🔥🐙🔥
[1/30/2014 1:14:14 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: michael is a character i would never attempt to play or cas
[1/30/2014 1:14:45 AM] Deano: I won't try angels anymore my Cas is okayyyy but meh. I can play demons tho
[1/30/2014 1:15:04 AM] Deano: I really want to explore Hindu demonology and make an OC
[1/30/2014 1:15:11 AM] Deano: But I don't need any more blogs
[1/30/2014 1:15:11 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: angels are tricky
[1/30/2014 1:15:29 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao nobody needs anymore but we still make them
[1/30/2014 1:15:39 AM] Deano: So many stories to tellll
[1/30/2014 1:16:54 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: basically. originally i was just going to make lucifer. but gabriel didn't have many episodes so i went for him instead;; but it turns out that i have more muse for luci than gabriel (idea)  and my grasp on him is better
[1/30/2014 1:17:04 AM] Deano: I have this one OC who I made during the height if the Leviathan stuff and he was one of the people to like swallow the black goo and I said when they killed Dick he woke up and didn't remember any of his past and he's a giant teddy bear and I love him
[1/30/2014 1:17:32 AM] Deano: Gabriel doesn't have many episodes but there's like a billion tumblrs for him lol
[1/30/2014 1:17:49 AM] Deano: There are less Lucifers and even less amazing Lucifers like you
[1/30/2014 1:17:51 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: n'awwwwws. omg. i love ocs;; there's so much you can do with them.
[1/30/2014 1:18:17 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: amazing. bahaha. idk if i'm amazing but i am trying. i do a lot of research before i dive in
[1/30/2014 1:18:19 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: so it helps
[1/30/2014 1:18:26 AM] Deano: Good well thought out OC's some suck lol
[1/30/2014 1:18:38 AM] Deano: I've played some sucky OC's in the past I am ashamed xD
[1/30/2014 1:18:41 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: they do. lmfao
[1/30/2014 1:18:52 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: it's hard with ocs
[1/30/2014 1:19:02 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: because you have to flesh it all out yourself
[1/30/2014 1:19:10 AM] Deano: Mhm. It's hard with characters with little backstory too
[1/30/2014 1:19:17 AM] Deano: I've struggled with Kali a lot
[1/30/2014 1:19:23 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: it is. same with kol.
[1/30/2014 1:19:37 AM] Deano: Because Hindu stuff and trying to make it fit with supernatural without ruining it lol
[1/30/2014 1:19:45 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: kol has a backstory but he's not very well thought out;; he had very little screen time and no flashbacks
[1/30/2014 1:19:53 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: even though he's from the 10th century
[1/30/2014 1:20:03 AM] Deano: Oof
[1/30/2014 1:20:04 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: you're doing a brilliant job
[1/30/2014 1:20:12 AM] Deano: :$
[1/30/2014 1:20:17 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: seriously. your kali's fucking amazeballs
[1/30/2014 1:20:42 AM] *** Deano hides under the bed. ***
[1/30/2014 1:20:46 AM] Deano: Thank
[1/30/2014 1:21:01 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: you're welcome. xD
[1/30/2014 1:21:27 AM] Deano: I didn't expect her muse to be so strong and I was super nervous about playing her and then she was just like BOOM and dean muse hid in a corner for like a month lol
[1/30/2014 1:22:01 AM] Deano: When Gabe and I first met we played Debriel and Then we connected and I was like hey *poke poke* try this thing with me
[1/30/2014 1:22:08 AM] Deano: And now we have feels
[1/30/2014 1:22:30 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao I felt the same way with Lucifer. Like it was legit a match made in Hell, not even gonna lie. Before I even made the blog I had a name and theme picked out and was like........... this is obviously a sign. (idea)
[1/30/2014 1:22:37 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he's my heart muse
[1/30/2014 1:23:04 AM] Deano: OUR FUTURE CHILDREN ARE SHIKHA AND DEVA AND SHIKHA WANTS TO BE JUST LIKE HER PAPA AND SHES A LITTKE SHIT AND DEVA IS A MAATAS BOY AND HES CUDDLY AND ADORBS AND THEY ARE TWINS
[1/30/2014 1:23:14 AM] Deano: YESSS that is a sign lol
[1/30/2014 1:23:21 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: Nawwwws omg babies D:
[1/30/2014 1:23:36 AM] Deano: I JUST LOVE BABIES
[1/30/2014 1:23:48 AM] Deano: Especially goddess archangel babies
[1/30/2014 1:23:51 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: I want there to be more Kali/Gabe moments.
[1/30/2014 1:24:03 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: it NEEDS to haPPEN
[1/30/2014 1:24:58 AM] Deano: IF SUPERNATURAL BRINGS GABE BACK I WILL A) BE HORRIFIED THAT THEY WILL FUCK HIM UP B) THEY BETTER FUCKING MENTION THAT IT WAS KALI THAT BROUGHT HIM BACK BECAUSE BOUND TO ME NOW AND FOREVER BITCHES
[1/30/2014 1:25:22 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: YESSSSS EXACTLY
[1/30/2014 1:25:30 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he was still bound to her when he died
[1/30/2014 1:25:34 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: which means
[1/30/2014 1:25:34 AM] Deano: YEP
[1/30/2014 1:25:52 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: that it would've resurrected him right?
[1/30/2014 1:26:07 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: i know richard said the writers told him he was still alive in a tweet
[1/30/2014 1:26:13 AM] Deano: In our canon she did a spell u.u
[1/30/2014 1:26:15 AM] Deano: Omfg
[1/30/2014 1:26:30 AM] Deano: I don't want him to have faked his death tho
[1/30/2014 1:26:37 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: that's why his status on wiki is unknown
[1/30/2014 1:26:39 AM] Deano: It takes away from all that pain and trashes it
[1/30/2014 1:26:42 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: i dont want him too
[1/30/2014 1:26:45 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: to*
[1/30/2014 1:26:47 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: either
[1/30/2014 1:26:52 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: it would trash his character
[1/30/2014 1:26:57 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: but resurrection is okay
[1/30/2014 1:27:09 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: because he still would have died for his cause
[1/30/2014 1:27:17 AM] Deano: Yep
[1/30/2014 1:27:37 AM] Deano: Gabes canon is that he went in their planning to die cries
[1/30/2014 1:27:41 AM] Deano: Breaks my heart
[1/30/2014 1:27:42 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: and if you think about it, it makes sense because he was still bound to Kali when he died.
[1/30/2014 1:28:03 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: I think he did too.
[1/30/2014 1:28:11 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: I don't think he expected to come out of there
[1/30/2014 1:28:28 AM] Deano: Yeah ;(
[1/30/2014 1:28:34 AM] Deano: It makes kali much sad
[1/30/2014 1:28:42 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: because he knew lucifer was stronger and it would be suicide.
[1/30/2014 1:28:54 AM] Deano: Weeps
[1/30/2014 1:28:58 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: babies
[1/30/2014 1:29:12 AM] Deano: A reason Kali's like fuck this shit just let him tear my heart out
[1/30/2014 1:29:27 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: to luci?
[1/30/2014 1:29:32 AM] Deano: Yep
[1/30/2014 1:29:39 AM] Deano: Ughhhh
[1/30/2014 1:29:42 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: Luci's an ass
[1/30/2014 1:29:46 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he doesn't care
[1/30/2014 1:30:02 AM] Deano: She's stubborn and prideful
[1/30/2014 1:30:16 AM] Deano: And doesn't like being called names >.>
[1/30/2014 1:30:22 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: but a part of me thinks that deep down, Gabriel's speech struck a chord.
[1/30/2014 1:30:38 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: which is why he turned around on Michael
[1/30/2014 1:30:40 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: on the field
[1/30/2014 1:31:06 AM] Deano: ;-;
[1/30/2014 1:31:06 AM] Deano: Bless
[1/30/2014 1:31:12 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: but idk
[1/30/2014 1:31:33 AM] Deano: I doubt kali could ever strike a chord LOL
[1/30/2014 1:31:51 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: i'm still fleshing him out. he obviously loved Gabriel because the look on his face when he killed him was heart breaking.
[1/30/2014 1:31:59 AM] Deano: Gabe told me to run and I was like BUT THEN NO MORE THREAD¿??¿¿
[1/30/2014 1:32:15 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: so i don't think he's entirely heartless. but i do believe he's narcissistic and doesn't take blame for his own actions
[1/30/2014 1:32:28 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: LMFAO
[1/30/2014 1:32:30 AM] Deano: I've seen HOTG A gillion times and it still kills me
[1/30/2014 1:32:42 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: I know. ;n;
[1/30/2014 1:32:45 AM] Deano: And yes spot on lucifer

[1/30/2014 1:33:02 AM] Deano: Yes
[1/30/2014 1:33:14 AM] Deano: He blames others it's never his own fault
[1/30/2014 1:33:19 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: He does.
[1/30/2014 1:33:28 AM] Deano: I hate those kinds of people irl lol
[1/30/2014 1:33:38 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he doesn't believe what he's doing is wrong;; he believes he's the victim;;
[1/30/2014 1:33:46 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he blames everyone else for his actions
[1/30/2014 1:33:48 AM] Deano: Yep
[1/30/2014 1:33:55 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: even though getting banished was entirely his fault
[1/30/2014 1:34:19 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he puts it off on god and michael for betraying him and booting him out for being different.
[1/30/2014 1:34:23 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: like LOL - no
[1/30/2014 1:35:01 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: I honestly think he believes his own lies.
[1/30/2014 1:35:10 AM] Deano: Poor bb
[1/30/2014 1:35:12 AM] Deano: Lol
[1/30/2014 1:36:00 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he thinks he's doing the right thing by purging humanity
[1/30/2014 1:36:17 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: because they're lowly to him
[1/30/2014 1:36:30 AM] Deano: XD
[1/30/2014 1:36:45 AM] Deano: He must hate the fact that he has to ride around in one
[1/30/2014 1:36:51 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: sorry i tend to ramble and shit.
[1/30/2014 1:37:24 AM] Deano: Don't be sorry I do the same it's awesome
[1/30/2014 1:37:36 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: it's a necessity but no, i doubt that he's happy about it. he hates humanity.
[1/30/2014 1:37:47 AM] Deano: Also I try to be all classy on Kali on tumblr and I get on Skype and I'm just like KEYSMASH
[1/30/2014 1:38:13 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao Same;; I'm just like oMF dlsldkdllsdkklsd come love me
[1/30/2014 1:38:21 AM] Deano: Kali's muse is so strong I can't even ooc post / send messages without her hissing at me
[1/30/2014 1:38:46 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: she must be really upset now. LOL
[1/30/2014 1:39:16 AM] Deano: She'll cope plus Skype is under deans name

[1/30/2014 1:43:33 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: also lucifer hates demons, so i'm trying to figure out how to respond to this post from Meg. he sees them as almost as useless as humans;;
[1/30/2014 1:43:48 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: cooperating with a muse who hates everyone =
[1/30/2014 1:44:19 AM] Deano: Awww
[1/30/2014 1:44:36 AM] Deano: Gonna give her daddy issues
[1/30/2014 1:44:40 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he's not very cooperative. (idea)
[1/30/2014 1:44:48 AM] Deano: Kali tolerates demons
[1/30/2014 1:45:17 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao and she has a bias for CERTAIN angels.
[1/30/2014 1:45:39 AM] Deano: I ALSO HAVE HEASCANONS ABOUT HER AND DEMON BLOOD AND THATS WHY I NEED HER AND A SAM TO BE FRIENDS BUT THEY NEVER GET ALONG lol
[1/30/2014 1:46:31 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: ahahahhahaa she doesn't get along with sam?
[1/30/2014 1:46:56 AM] Deano: She hasn't yet which is weird because she finds him less annoying than dean
[1/30/2014 1:47:34 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao I would too. Most angels seem to hate Dean
[1/30/2014 1:47:37 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: like Balthy
[1/30/2014 1:47:40 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: god i love balthy
[1/30/2014 1:47:53 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: s2g he's my second favourite angel
[1/30/2014 1:47:53 AM] Deano: Omfg there's this kali that rps and ships dean/Kali and I'm laughing bc if my kali ever did sleep with a dean he wouldn't survive intercourse
[1/30/2014 1:48:25 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he wouldn't. she'd praying mantis his ass.
[1/30/2014 1:48:27 AM] Deano: I ship Sam/balthy dean/Cas because parallels
[1/30/2014 1:48:34 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: I agree
[1/30/2014 1:48:47 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: Sam and Balthazar had a comraderie thing starting
[1/30/2014 1:49:14 AM] Deano: Haha one time in rp I got my husband Cas nearly killed and Balthazar broke myface it was awesome
[1/30/2014 1:49:38 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao omfg.

[1/30/2014 1:50:27 AM] Deano: And yes as dean xD
[1/30/2014 1:50:47 AM] Deano: Kali is fond of Cas but only to a certain extent lol
[1/30/2014 1:50:57 AM] Deano: And really just because Gabe loves him
[1/30/2014 1:51:15 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: Yeah, she tolerates him. For Gabriel.
[1/30/2014 1:51:23 AM] Deano: Yeo
[1/30/2014 1:51:36 AM] Deano: KALI NEEDS A FUCKING FRIEND THO SERIOUSLY
[1/30/2014 1:52:00 AM] Deano: like a lady she can sip tea with and slaughter things occasionally

[1/30/2014 1:53:25 AM] Deano: I fucking love Gabriel
[1/30/2014 1:53:56 AM] Deano: I keep looking for ladies for Kali but most are evil. There was an Anna I was gonna thread with but she's not around much
[1/30/2014 1:53:56 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: boohoo daddy brought home the new baby and you couldn't handle it, now you're down here smashing up all of his toys;; this is just one big old temper-tantrum.  ---- Lucifer's like..... <.<
[1/30/2014 1:54:05 AM] Deano: Hehehe
[1/30/2014 1:54:10 AM] Deano: Inner Kali cackles
[1/30/2014 1:54:38 AM] Deano: Ps I sometimes quote her "your story, not ours" speech randomly from memory
[1/30/2014 1:54:56 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: LMAO I love Gabe for it, tho.
[1/30/2014 1:55:08 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: bahahahaha

[1/30/2014 1:57:56 AM] Deano: Slightly off topic
[1/30/2014 1:57:59 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: LMFAO
[1/30/2014 1:58:12 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: omfg crying
[1/30/2014 2:03:51 AM] Luci {--Ash--}:  ”Do not pretend to be better than my people. You are the chink in your fathers armor, you are the reason he left. I’ve heard the stories. You claim to love Him, but you cannot truly feel love. Too much hate resides in your heart.” --- this tho;;; kali you got balls omg
[1/30/2014 2:04:40 AM] Deano: >.>.>.>.>.>
[1/30/2014 2:04:54 AM] Deano: She's got the stupid disease
[1/30/2014 2:04:55 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: bahahahahaa
[1/30/2014 2:05:06 AM] Deano: It took me so long to write that
[1/30/2014 2:05:18 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: LMFAO were you terrified?
[1/30/2014 2:05:21 AM] Deano: Because I kept typing out what she should say and she kept going HAHA NOPE

[1/30/2014 2:05:36 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: LMFAO
[1/30/2014 2:06:10 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: My Kol once threw a Damon across a bar and gutted him with a broken off pool stick.
[1/30/2014 2:06:49 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: but i don't think lucifer will do anything to kali.
[1/30/2014 2:07:48 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: hopefully not
[1/30/2014 2:08:50 AM] Deano: D :
[1/30/2014 2:08:54 AM] Deano: I hope not too
[1/30/2014 2:09:15 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: I dont think so.
[1/30/2014 2:09:20 AM] Deano: Hopefully she can just annoy him to a point where he's just like shoo
[1/30/2014 2:09:34 AM] Deano: Does he know she brought Gabriel back?
[1/30/2014 2:09:38 AM] Deano: Trolol
[1/30/2014 2:09:55 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: No, he doesn't. At this point, he thinks Gabriel's dead.
[1/30/2014 2:11:46 AM] Deano: *silently wonders how he would react lol*
[1/30/2014 2:11:48 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: he's just like lololol wut now, your boyfriend aint here to save your ass.
[1/30/2014 2:12:05 AM] Deano: Kali will probs just play along tho and pretend Gabe is dead to protect him
[1/30/2014 2:12:11 AM] Deano: PLUS SHE DONT NEED NO MAN
[1/30/2014 2:12:41 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: LMFAO he would probably be like..............what did you just say to me? >.>

[1/30/2014 2:15:04 AM] Deano: My dean?
[1/30/2014 2:15:15 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: "But not the suicidally crazy type you prefer, am I right dick bag?  —-"
[1/30/2014 2:15:16 AM] Deano: She wouldn't tell him Gabe was alive LOL
[1/30/2014 2:15:17 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: no ashes

[1/30/2014 9:34:59 PM] Deano: *hugs face* I'm here for you, if/when you wanna talk about it. I felt like that in High School, so I can relate. Most of my friends now I just know online
[1/30/2014 9:36:21 PM] Luci {--Ash--}: :( Yeah, idk. I mean I try to make friends, but it just feels like they don't really care to have me around;; they just tolerate me. :/
[1/30/2014 9:37:12 PM] Deano: I think the best advice I can give is just don't give up. :/ I know it's not much
[1/30/2014 9:38:39 PM] Luci {--Ash--}: It gets hard to handle sometimes. :/
[1/30/2014 9:39:02 PM] Deano: I know bb ;-; I'm sorry
[1/30/2014 9:39:08 PM] Luci {--Ash--}: I'm not well socialized
[1/30/2014 9:39:17 PM] Luci {--Ash--}: so making friends is difficult for me
[1/30/2014 9:39:53 PM] Deano: We're friends u.u I think you're awesome

[2/1/2014 2:07:41 AM] Luci {--Ash--}:   Fury burned beneath the fragile exterior of Lucifer’s flesh prison, her tone drawing forth the terrifying wrath which she bore witness to when he’d obliterated the other lesser Deities, reducing their pathetic existences to mere visceral reminders on the walls. Every venomous syllable drove the dagger deeper, ignited the rage in his belly, forcing him to the very boundary line of his comfort zone. Admittance to fault, or facing the monstrosity that he’d become, was not something the exiled Archangel took lightly.
[2/1/2014 2:07:44 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: ............ <.<
[2/1/2014 2:08:03 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: i'm so sorry for this
[2/1/2014 2:08:49 AM] Deano: Don't be sorry she asked for it
[2/1/2014 2:08:57 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao
[2/1/2014 2:09:03 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: gabriel might have to save her
[2/1/2014 2:09:04 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: omg

[2/1/2014 2:11:17 AM] Deano: Kali does not want that lol

     ”What did you just say to me?”

      It slipped out in a deadly calm, azure irises flickering with muted promises of violence as he drifted forward, visibly unperturbed by her insolence, though coiling for the strike. Only when he slaughtered, did he feel peace. Complete control ratcheting the entirety of his psyche, burgeoning him with the insurmountable power that he craved, their lives
[2/1/2014 2:28:45 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: this is crap soz;;
[2/1/2014 2:30:56 AM] Deano: Oh shit
[2/1/2014 2:31:07 AM] Deano: Kali uses intense fear
[2/1/2014 2:31:11 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: LMFAO
[2/1/2014 2:31:24 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: is she scared?
[2/1/2014 2:32:04 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: i love how he's so calm, yet pissed off at the same time. XD
[2/1/2014 2:32:07 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: it's unnerving
[2/1/2014 2:41:07 AM] Deano: YeS
[2/1/2014 2:41:27 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: and i wonder why nobody wants to rp with me. LOL
[2/1/2014 2:42:15 AM] Deano: HAHA it's okay kali is the same way
[2/1/2014 2:42:26 AM] Deano: Everybody's either scared of her or she pisses them off
[2/1/2014 2:42:32 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao
[2/1/2014 2:43:17 AM] Deano: Ugh I don't know what she's even going to do
[2/1/2014 2:43:35 AM] Luci {--Ash--}:   It slipped out in a deadly calm, azure irises flickering with muted promises of violence as he drifted forward, visibly unperturbed by her insolence, though coiling for the strike.

Dirt, sparsely grinding between his toes; humanity and it’s ilk proved to be nothing more than an irritant, including sympathizers…. like Gabriel, and now the girl he’d so stupidly given his life for.
[2/1/2014 2:43:41 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: I'm honestly scared for her
[2/1/2014 2:44:30 AM] Deano: Uggggg

[2/1/2014 2:47:27 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: lmfao
[2/1/2014 2:47:31 AM] Deano: We just need a reason for him not to kill her <.<
[2/1/2014 2:47:39 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: yeah lmfao.
[2/1/2014 2:47:52 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: you still have time to reiterate
[2/1/2014 2:51:19 AM] Deano: She's too-- what's the word?
[2/1/2014 2:51:33 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: scared shitless?

[2/1/2014 2:54:04 AM] Deano: This is gonna bug me
[2/1/2014 2:54:26 AM] Deano: It's like a word where you find it hard to admit your wrong/mistakes
[2/1/2014 2:54:26 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: what is?
[2/1/2014 2:54:31 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: Ooooh

[2/1/2014 2:59:07 AM] Luci {--Ash--}:   Such an inane, useless move — considering the action was about to be rendered pointless with a twitch of his fingers, the implosion of eviscerated flesh particles a few triggers away. Or less. Hatred was an emotion he knew all too well, fed from it, thrived off of it, allowing the poisonous essence to consume him and filter out
[2/1/2014 2:59:12 AM] Luci {--Ash--}: i rattle too much

[2/3/2014 12:38:18 AM] Lucifer: lmfao they would get along quite well if they didn't hate each other.
[2/3/2014 12:39:13 AM] Lucifer:   Thousands of years enraptured in eternal hellfire had not been kind, searing every shred of reckless ardor from his core until only a chard resonance remained; a skeletal structure, barely recognizable to what he once was;—— the carefree, rebellious angel who bucked Daddy’s command for his own willful path.  Forsaking Heaven and order, Lucifer denied Humanity, refusing to acknowledge their flawed existence. They were insecure wads of self-loathing bile, unworthy of the affections Father had shown them, irritating little corpuscles of filth scourging the Earth like a viral plague.  Wallowed in sin and vice, soiling the choice they were given, yet he was punished and branded a heretic for rejecting what clearly needed eradication.

     A monster made from familial betrayal, left to brew in the juices of his hatred, rage putrefying every particle of his being. To destroy Michael would end it, sever the final lifeline to Heaven and grant him the power he deserved: a King fit to govern without the chink of weakness that was his Father’s Achilles heel, mankind.  And as much as he loved his brother, some things were simply unavoidable; sometimes necessary evils were required to achieve goals, weeding out the infallible to ensure the strong survived.  Like Gabriel, and the Pagan scum to whose defense he’d so stupidly come running, all sacrifices to clear the way for Anarchy’s reign.  

     The hard twinge of guilt twisting around his vessel’s heart became quickly drowned out by numb despondence, as cold as the blade gripped in his crimson stained fingers and the detached emotion settling in the azure opticals of his borrowed flesh.

                 No room for pity, no expense for empathy.  

                                               This was war.

 His unwavering gaze, sharpened by time and paranoia, roamed Balthazar’s features, narrowing into slits of apparent suspicion, absorbing every syllable rolling off of the younger angel’s tongue as if he were judging for deception, for fallacy in cadence, placid calm mingled with the slightly crazed,  warped curvature hinging the corner of his lip, eluding to sinister dangers lurking beneath the stoic demeanor while still maintaining steadfast  composure.

    “You think airing out our feelings is the answer?” A derisive snort hitched at the back of his throat, line of sight peeling off of the other angel as he turned to the frosted window pane, methodically running his index finger over the tactile ice.
[2/3/2014 12:39:19 AM] Lucifer: look how long this fucker is tho

[2/3/2014 12:47:38 AM] Kālī (Deano): Good u.u
[2/3/2014 12:48:45 AM] Lucifer: it's helping me with Gabriel too, as I'm not used to that type of character, it's out of my comfort zone. I'm used to characters like Lucifer.... darker characters.
[2/3/2014 12:49:44 AM] Lucifer: serial killers, psychotics, sociopaths, etc.
[2/3/2014 12:52:12 AM] Kālī (Deano): Oooh
[2/3/2014 12:52:30 AM] Kālī (Deano): I'm best at dean tbh

[2/3/2014 12:52:46 AM] Kālī (Deano): I can't play angels at all
[2/3/2014 12:52:52 AM] Kālī (Deano): Idk why I have a hard time gettin in their heads
[2/3/2014 12:53:16 AM] Lucifer: really? i could never play someone like Cas. '
[2/3/2014 12:53:41 AM] Lucifer: I tried once and it was a travesty. XD
[2/3/2014 12:53:53 AM] Kālī (Deano): SaME my Cas is awful lol
[2/3/2014 12:54:58 AM | Edited 12:55:18 AM] Lucifer: I only took Gabriel because he just had four episodes and not much development. I wanted to make a Lucifer but I was chicken shit because he had so much more screen time.
[2/3/2014 12:55:45 AM] Lucifer: I had gabe for like a month before I caved and made Lucifer
[2/3/2014 12:58:40 AM] Lucifer: I tried Dean too. And he sucked.
[2/3/2014 12:58:42 AM] Lucifer: lmfao
[2/3/2014 12:59:15 AM] Lucifer: my gabriel probably sucks lmfao
[2/3/2014 1:00:02 AM] Kālī (Deano): I'm sure he doesn't suck u.u if you want to practice him with me I'm more than willing I just don't do shippy things xD
[2/3/2014 1:02:11 AM] Lucifer: lmao i'm kinda embarrassed of him D:   http://infinitelyxcomplicated.tumblr.com  yuo can follow me if you want and we can do crack stuff. i'm not all that confident with him yet anyway.
[2/3/2014 1:02:29 AM] Kālī (Deano): I follow with dean : D
[2/3/2014 1:02:36 AM] Kālī (Deano): Bulletsandbunkers
[2/3/2014 1:02:52 AM] Lucifer: okay. oh, well. i don't ship debriel romantically.
[2/3/2014 1:02:54 AM] Kālī (Deano): I saw you playing with other Kali lol
[2/3/2014 1:03:19 AM] Lucifer: i did one toss. she doesn't give me much
[2/3/2014 1:03:32 AM] Lucifer: so i'm not sure how to reply to her.
[2/3/2014 1:03:40 AM] Kālī (Deano): Yeah she's with weeklyworldnews

[2/3/2014 1:05:19 AM] Kālī (Deano): Her and myself anyway
[2/3/2014 1:05:24 AM] Lucifer: but my gabriel is crappy so that's probably why i can't find one. XD
[2/3/2014 1:05:43 AM] Kālī (Deano): They're hard to find bb her and me are really the only active ones
[2/3/2014 1:06:08 AM] Kālī (Deano): And I didn't make my account until I already had a Gabe
[2/3/2014 1:08:01 AM] Lucifer: yeah eh. i mean it would be nice to build on something because i've never actually gotten to have a feelsy ship or whatever but that never happens for me, so I'm not banking on anything. :/
[2/3/2014 1:08:35 AM] Lucifer: my friend and her god were going to build on something and she ditched the account
[2/3/2014 1:08:40 AM] Lucifer: so yeah
[2/3/2014 1:08:45 AM] Kālī (Deano): ;-;
[2/3/2014 1:09:00 AM] Kālī (Deano): I find it's easier to build relationships playing in real time
[2/3/2014 1:09:10 AM] Kālī (Deano): Like on Skype
[2/3/2014 1:09:38 AM] Lucifer: yeah.
[2/3/2014 1:10:42 AM] Kālī (Deano): Of course then you run the risk of hardly ever playing on tumblr xD
[2/3/2014 1:10:50 AM] Lucifer: lmao
[2/3/2014 1:11:36 AM] Lucifer: idk nobody ever asks me to skype rp and i've never really thought to ask anyone.

[2/3/2014 1:30:14 AM] Kālī (Deano): The end of that video omg lol
[2/3/2014 1:30:17 AM] Lucifer: but yeah, he's angry and feels betrayed because God chose humanity over him and had him booted for refusing them; and he feels Michael's betrayed him for doing it.
[2/3/2014 1:30:51 AM] Lucifer: which is why he hates them, people.
[2/3/2014 1:31:07 AM] Kālī (Deano): Yep~
[2/3/2014 1:31:16 AM] Kālī (Deano): His speech in end verse episode
[2/3/2014 1:31:18 AM] Lucifer: because he doesn't feel like they deserve the love that they've been given.
[2/3/2014 1:31:32 AM] Lucifer: which episode?

[2/3/2014 1:31:56 AM] Kālī (Deano): Ummm season 5
[2/3/2014 1:32:06 AM] Kālī (Deano): I think it's the third episode but I might be wrong
[2/3/2014 1:33:00 AM] Lucifer: i still don't believe he's right for what he's doing. i get his anger. but he's also not justified for wanting to exterminate them either. <.<
[2/3/2014 1:33:51 AM] Kālī (Deano): Lol

Michael only knows the blind faith of our Father’s command, he doesn’t listen to reason, just his pride. Right now, I’m public enemy number one;

[2/3/2014 2:46:21 AM] Lucifer: and it bothers me
[2/3/2014 2:46:34 AM] Kālī (Deano): I blacklisted sastiel because I was dean and she was Cas and we were dating irl and she left me for a Sam and we broke up
[2/3/2014 2:46:52 AM] Lucifer: ;( the one chick?

[2/3/2014 2:51:51 AM] Lucifer: chibis are adorbs XD
[2/3/2014 3:16:24 AM] Lucifer: Lucifer is a very layered character, and the more I delve into him, the more I start to see that …. his sense of justice, he feels has been violated.  I’m not excusing what he’s done or what he’s doing —- because he’s obviously a very manipulative and cruel guy. But, I don’t think he was always this way. Nor do I feel as if he, himself, is coming from a place of bad. He feels as if he’s been wronged, betrayed by someone that he loved so much, over these….broken, flawed beings: people. Not only was he asked to love them more than his father, but he was asked to serve them, the morning star, the angel of virtue, commanded to bow down to vice; — and, because he rebelled, he was cast out and damned to an eternity in Hell.
[2/3/2014 3:16:30 AM] Lucifer: casually writing a headcanon whoosh

LOL we only really write two characters together. she wants to do dark stuff with them, like Balthazar swaying over to the bad side.  i haven't really said much about it bc i'm still not sure.... i've never slash shipped -.- and I don't want to trash my character over it. :/

[2/3/2014 11:53:35 AM] Lucifer: yeah idk i'm hesitant.
[2/3/2014 11:53:53 AM] Lucifer: yeah, it just takes proper planning.
[2/3/2014 11:54:03 AM] Kālī (Deano): Maybe test it out on Skype before jumping it to tumblr lol
[2/3/2014 11:57:23 AM] Lucifer: maybe. idk. you're talking to someone whose never really shipped anything --- so yeah, I'm hesitant but I don't want to be a dick about it either and tell her no. :/ I'm so conflicted.

[2/3/2014 11:59:37 AM] Kālī (Deano): There's no point in playing a ship you don't have feels for. She'll be able to feel that if you play it

[2/3/2014 12:03:40 PM] Lucifer: it wouldn't hurt to try it. and see. and if it doesn't work then it doesn't work. i'm just not going to push for one. (idea) i myself don't really feel like lucifer is suitable for a ship, because he's the angel of virtue, his whole reason of rebellion was because God commanded he serve vice, and sex is vice.
[2/3/2014 12:04:32 PM] Lucifer: I just feel like he would look down on that sort of thing and hold it at a derogatory level.
[2/3/2014 12:04:37 PM] Lucifer: but that's just me.

[2/16/2014 6:06:53 PM] Lucifer: and honestly, the self-promoing i feel will discourage rpers. especially when you're all "i've been rping for x amount of years and i'm a selective followback etcetera.
[2/16/2014 6:07:03 PM] Lucifer: it makes people feel unworthy
[2/16/2014 6:07:15 PM] Lucifer: especially when they follow you and you don't follow back

[2/16/2014 6:07:29 PM] Lucifer: and that's not what rp is fucking about

[2/17/2014 12:53:59 PM] Kālì (Deano): Yeah just now xD the urls still bulletsandbunkers
[2/17/2014 12:54:17 PM] Kālì (Deano): It's just all my followers were inactive and it annoyede
[2/17/2014 12:55:33 PM] Lucifer: yeah i getchu. i should've moved lucifer from kol but i couldn't be arsed.
[2/17/2014 12:57:44 PM] Lucifer: i'm seriously on the verge of unfollowing emily. i'm getting annoyed with her continuously posting her fucking follower counts and shit. :/
[2/17/2014 12:58:53 PM] Kālì (Deano): Lol I'll probably unfollow soon.. I've got her tumblr saviored for now
[2/17/2014 12:59:34 PM] Lucifer: she already dropped our thread on gabriel, which i'm sort of pissed about.
[2/17/2014 12:59:42 PM] Lucifer: because i spent hours on that fucking response.
[2/17/2014 1:01:35 PM] Lucifer: she told me that she and i quote "lost the thread" and then went on to say that "she hates the character of gabriel and the post was too long for her to respond to"
[2/17/2014 1:01:37 PM] Lucifer: :|
[2/17/2014 1:02:49 PM] Kālì (Deano): Jesus fucking christ
[2/17/2014 1:03:03 PM] Kālì (Deano): Yeah fuck it. I'm re-blocking her on Skype and unfollowing
[2/17/2014 1:03:19 PM] Lucifer: lmfao reblocking
[2/17/2014 1:04:00 PM] Kālì (Deano): I had her blocked then she called me out on it oops
[2/17/2014 1:04:01 PM] Lucifer: yeah, i was really mad. ngl. bc i spend hours on my fucking posts only for someone to decide that they're not going to respond because i gave them too much??
[2/17/2014 1:04:10 PM] Lucifer: why'd you block her?
[2/17/2014 1:09:01 PM] Kālì (Deano): She annoys me with her destiel hating attitude. Like the Chatzy was supposed to be about Gabe and she made it all about her and then Milly made a joke about destiel and she fucking left because she's a child. Also I would defend Milly with my life I love that girl
[2/17/2014 1:10:18 PM] Lucifer: :( When was this? The bacholor thing?
[2/17/2014 1:10:28 PM] Kālì (Deano): Yeah
[2/17/2014 1:10:47 PM] Lucifer: I wasn't there for a lot of it, bc I had to run off to school. D:
[2/17/2014 1:11:00 PM] Lucifer: so i don't know what all went down.
[2/17/2014 1:11:04 PM] Kālì (Deano): It's okay, it was just supposed to be a derpy crack thing
[2/17/2014 1:11:50 PM] Kālì (Deano): It's just she left and then messaged me on Skype "omg I had to wait for Adam to leave" who is Milly and I was like JFC
[2/17/2014 1:11:51 PM] Lucifer: but damn. yeah, her destiel hate gets on my nerves. i mean, i'm not the biggest fan of it, but you don't see me ranting about it all over the dash all the time.
[2/17/2014 1:12:07 PM] Kālì (Deano): All Milly said was "deans too busy staring at Cas's butt"
[2/17/2014 1:12:15 PM] Kālì (Deano): Which is probably true for my dean anyway LOL
[2/17/2014 1:12:18 PM] Lucifer: lmfao
[2/17/2014 1:12:36 PM] Lucifer: Milly seemed nice. Emily can go fuck herself.
[2/17/2014 1:12:45 PM] Kālì (Deano): Some fans take it too far, but I like destiel.
[2/17/2014 1:12:52 PM] Kālì (Deano): Milly is a total sweetheart
[2/17/2014 1:13:07 PM] Lucifer: People can ship what they want.
[2/17/2014 1:13:22 PM] Kālì (Deano): If Emily asks why I haven't replied I'm gonna tell her in lost it and I don't like Balthazar anyway
[2/17/2014 1:13:53 PM] Lucifer: I don't think I'm doing the Balcifer with her. IDK. I already feel uncomfortable with it.
[2/17/2014 1:14:28 PM] Lucifer: it doesn't feel right to me, so I think I'm going to deviate myself away from it, bc I don't think Lucifer would stoop to that level.
[2/17/2014 1:14:34 PM] Kālì (Deano): plUs how can you hate Gabriel just wtf
[2/17/2014 1:14:37 PM] Kālì (Deano): And agreed
[2/17/2014 1:14:48 PM] Lucifer: I know, right?? Gabriel's hilarious.
[2/17/2014 1:14:56 PM] Kālì (Deano): Just come do being human stuff with Gabe and I uvu
[2/17/2014 1:15:15 PM] Lucifer: Lucifer's not really that shippable.
[2/17/2014 1:15:27 PM] Kālì (Deano): I kinda ship Samifer but in a cracky way
[2/17/2014 1:15:31 PM] Lucifer: He doesn't see vice the same way that Gabriel and Balthazar do.
[2/17/2014 1:15:44 PM] Lucifer: that's the whole reason why he got booted tbw
[2/17/2014 1:15:50 PM] Lucifer: because he stood against it
[2/17/2014 1:15:54 PM] Lucifer: and refused to serve it
[2/17/2014 1:16:01 PM] Lucifer: lmfao

[2/17/2014 1:17:30 PM] Lucifer: I know!!
[2/17/2014 1:17:36 PM] Lucifer: she's a total hypocrite
[2/17/2014 1:18:11 PM] Kālì (Deano): It's like the time I got I to a fight with this dick wad Cas bc I said something about destiel and they freaked out saying how unhealthy it was they WERE DATING A CROWLEY
[2/17/2014 1:18:24 PM] Kālì (Deano): I was just like---- yeah dean can be a dick but he means well
[2/17/2014 1:19:00 PM] Lucifer: yeah, destiel is better than cas and crowley
[2/17/2014 1:19:19 PM] Kālì (Deano): Yeah. I do ship Gabe Crowley though lol
[2/17/2014 1:19:51 PM] Kālì (Deano): Just because it's fun
[2/17/2014 1:21:11 PM] Lucifer: their sass is legendary xD
[2/17/2014 1:21:35 PM] Kālì (Deano): Yep hehe
[2/17/2014 1:29:32 PM] Lucifer: xD
[2/17/2014 1:36:38 PM] Lucifer:   Character building is all about trial and error. To all of those out there who feel discouraged because you think you're not good enough or aren't doing it right, ----don't. We all start somewhere and fleshing out your character is meant to be an adventure, nobody is perfect. I see so many people on my dash who berate themselves because they don't feel like they're adequate, because they feel like they're doing something wrong, because they feel like they're being judged. And to be quite honest, posting follower counts and putting up elaborate self-promos boasting your selective follow-backs and experience doesn't help with that.

    If people don't follow back, rpers feel inferior - and that isn't what rping is supposed to be about. It's a hobby meant for enjoyment, not an application process. I feel like the vast majority of tumblr falls into the popularity trap; --- people come to equate follower count with quality and that isn't true. There are loads of blogs out there, hidden gems, who are just as brilliant with 300 followers as a blog with 1,500.
[2/17/2014 1:36:44 PM] Lucifer: ashleigh's posting a psa;
[2/17/2014 1:36:46 PM] Lucifer: oops?

[2/17/2014 1:55:21 PM] Lucifer: lmfao
[2/17/2014 1:55:25 PM] Lucifer: it's true tho
[2/17/2014 1:55:57 PM] Kālì (Deano): it is
[2/17/2014 1:56:20 PM] Lucifer: the self-promos piss me off
[2/17/2014 1:56:36 PM] Kālì (Deano): samee
[2/17/2014 1:57:00 PM] Lucifer: because it discourages people from following you. and tbh it's pompous.
[2/17/2014 1:57:26 PM] Kālì (Deano): agreed
[2/17/2014 1:57:40 PM] Kālì (Deano): plus seriously it's all about getting more followers and what's the point of having followers if you're not going to play with them
[2/17/2014 1:57:47 PM] Lucifer: exactly.
[2/17/2014 1:58:40 PM] Lucifer: my friend made one, which her reasonings, i get, bc she is a greek mythos rper and players there are scarce and she wanted more partners; --- that, i get. but what others do? making them and then constantly reblogging them?
[2/17/2014 1:58:43 PM] Lucifer: it's pompous
[2/17/2014 1:58:49 PM] Lucifer: and it makes you look like an asshole.
[2/17/2014 1:59:26 PM] Kālì (Deano): yep-- the closest I've concidered to doing it is making like bio posts / headcanons for other Hindu gods/goddess's because I'd freaking love to see some more of those
[2/17/2014 2:00:01 PM] Lucifer: I would too.

[5/16/2014 4:24:12 PM] Deano: Hey, I'd like to apologize for being a total bitch. I was way out of line, and I honestly don't know why I said those things but I'm sorry. I understand completely if you still don't want to talk to me, and I don't expect forgiveness. But I am sorry, and I wanted my apology out there.
[5/16/2014 4:25:18 PM] Lucifer: It's okay. I thuoght you were mad at me tbh which is why I hesitated in saying anyting more. But no, I'm not mad. I haven't been for awhile and I'm sorry if I came off snippy-
[5/16/2014 4:26:16 PM] Deano: You shouldn't be sorry, I just assumed you hated me (which would have been fair of you) I was being a cunt-waffle I don't know why. You had every right to be snippy.
[5/16/2014 4:27:09 PM] Lucifer: I don't hate you. It happens. We all make mistakes and put our foot in our mouth sometimes. It's all good.
[5/16/2014 4:28:07 PM] Deano: It was a mistake, and I'm massively sorry. I mean it. I won't do it again, and if I do you have my permission to throat punch me as hard as you'd like
[5/16/2014 4:28:42 PM] Lucifer: ahahaha it's okay dear. don't worry about it. i'm not made. i forgave you a long time ago (cat)
[5/16/2014 4:29:00 PM] Deano: Thank you (heart)
[5/16/2014 4:29:15 PM] Lucifer: (heart) you're welcome bae
[5/16/2014 4:29:51 PM] Deano: How have you been?
[5/16/2014 4:30:00 PM] Deano: I've missed you ;A;
[5/16/2014 4:30:59 PM] Lucifer: I've missed you too. ;n; I'm doing okay. Trying to keep up with blogs, catching up on SPN things, etc., I've been sucky at rping lately. Unfortunately. xD
[5/16/2014 4:31:03 PM] Lucifer: what about you?
[5/16/2014 4:33:33 PM] Deano: I'm doing a little better since school finished for the summer. Idk if Gabe ever talked to you about it but we've been struggling OOC, had a long talk last night though and things have been a little better.

Omg the finale of being human killed me
[5/16/2014 4:35:44 PM] Lucifer: Well, that's good. (cat) I hope things work out with you guys bc I know you were close and all. And yeah, I watched it. I was happy with the ending, Josh finally got to have something good happen to him for once, he had kids and all that. He deserves it tbh; sad about Aiden though but at least he's with Sally.
[5/16/2014 4:35:47 PM] Lucifer: which is nice
[5/16/2014 4:40:25 PM] Deano: We still are close, just been struggling lately. :/ I hope things go back to normal, because sometimes it's like a warzone lol

I was happy too but I was also totally crying in public lol watched it in the lounge.
[5/16/2014 4:42:28 PM] Lucifer: Yeah. ;~; I get emotional over episodes too. But lately it's just been anger, so BH's was a nice reprieve.
[5/16/2014 4:46:37 PM] Deano: Yeah~ I've been really disappointed in spn. I haven't watched it in a couple episodes
[5/16/2014 4:49:29 PM] Lucifer: I'm watching the new episode now, even though I already know what's going on from spoilers on my dash, but eh- I haven't been really paying attention to s9.
[5/16/2014 4:49:56 PM] Deano: I've seen spoilers, and I'm upset. Ugh. Abandons death made me laugh the scene was so bad
[5/16/2014 4:50:22 PM] Deano: Gabe wants me to make a metatron so I have to watch the new eps soon
[5/16/2014 4:52:40 PM] Lucifer: yea ahahaaha good luck with that. xD i'm not happy about gadreel getting the shit stick, that was tripe and he doesn't survive this season finale, i'm done. i'm not bothering with season 10.
[5/16/2014 4:53:20 PM] Deano: Thanks. I don't blame dean tho. If have stabbed him too lol
[5/16/2014 4:53:25 PM] Deano: *i'd
[5/16/2014 4:53:44 PM] Deano: I'm still bitter about Kevin
[5/16/2014 4:54:06 PM] Lucifer: It wasn't Gadreel's fault, tho. He was being manipulated....
[5/16/2014 4:54:37 PM] Deano: That's what everyone says ;-; but I just can't forgive him
[5/16/2014 4:54:47 PM] Deano: I legit just had this conversation with someone on tumblr lol
[5/16/2014 4:57:31 PM] Lucifer: lol idk, i'm not the biggest fan of dean this season anyway. and considering the shit that gadreel went through prior to the fall, and with the fact that he was desperate to be forgiven then.... he took whatever he could, and Metatron promised him that if he helped restore Heaven, Gadreel was under the assumption that he was doing the right thing and I can't fault him for that. sorry. :/
[5/16/2014 4:58:54 PM] Deano: I understand, and I even like gadreel. But I still think he had it coming <.> dean gave him chances, trusted him, and gadreel stabbed him in the back and tore apart his family. Plus deans not really himself rn all crazy balls
[5/16/2014 4:59:51 PM] Lucifer: yeah, the mark is fucking him up pretty bad.
[5/16/2014 5:01:18 PM] Deano: Mhm, I don't trust the writers anymore either tho
[5/16/2014 5:01:30 PM] Deano: I'm pissed as fuck about Tessa and I haven't watched it lol
[5/16/2014 5:01:41 PM] Deano: Supernatural treats women like shit

[5/16/2014 8:04:37 PM] Lucifer: the only consistent one i have is ash
[5/16/2014 8:05:10 PM] Lucifer: gabriel's a dick, so- i think most people are scared to write with me or something idek.
[5/16/2014 8:07:03 PM] Deano: bwahaha
[5/16/2014 8:07:11 PM] Deano: you can play with mine, he's a dick too
[5/16/2014 8:07:35 PM] Lucifer: ahahaha
[5/16/2014 8:07:44 PM] Deano: I GOTTA GO, bbl!
[5/16/2014 8:07:51 PM] Lucifer: okayy
[5/17/2014 12:15:11 AM] Deano: Back
[5/17/2014 12:15:20 AM] Lucifer: wb
[5/17/2014 12:15:26 AM] Deano: Thank
[5/17/2014 12:15:31 AM] Lucifer: painting's a bitch
[5/17/2014 12:15:34 AM] Lucifer: cries about it
[5/17/2014 12:15:46 AM] Deano: D :
[5/17/2014 12:18:00 AM] Lucifer: gonna give up for awhile and crack into some drafts, since the assigment isn't technically due until tues or thursday and i've already fucked part of it up.
[5/17/2014 12:20:50 AM] Lucifer: i hate everything ;~;
[5/17/2014 12:23:24 AM] Deano: I'm sorry bb ;-;
[5/17/2014 12:24:25 AM] Lucifer: everything i write sucks. and i'm going through one of those moods where i just feel like deleting everything. :/
[5/17/2014 12:25:35 AM] Deano: don't do it!
[5/17/2014 12:25:43 AM] Deano: ;-;
[5/17/2014 12:25:57 AM] Lucifer: like anybody would give a shit.
[5/17/2014 12:26:14 AM] Deano: I would
[5/17/2014 12:26:52 AM] Lucifer: ;~;
[5/17/2014 12:30:45 AM] Deano: -clings to-
[5/17/2014 12:30:55 AM] Deano: just got you back, no leaving
[5/17/2014 12:31:59 AM] Lucifer: -clings-
[5/17/2014 12:39:58 AM] Lucifer: i never thought i would stoop to this, considering this is what i complained about emily doing- but
[5/17/2014 12:40:26 AM] Deano: it's okay, we all have moments
[5/17/2014 12:41:19 AM] Lucifer: nobody wants to play with me, i'll play with myself. idegaf anymore.
[5/17/2014 12:41:27 AM] Deano: I wanna play ;A;
[5/17/2014 12:43:50 AM] Lucifer: i'm just sick of investing in threads and being fucking dropped and replaced. i really am.
[5/17/2014 12:46:18 AM] Deano: ;-;
[5/17/2014 12:49:56 AM] Lucifer: i mean, there's a reason why people do it. i'm obviously doing something wrong.
[5/17/2014 12:52:07 AM] Deano: people are stupid, you're a great rp'r
[5/17/2014 1:21:12 AM] Lucifer: lol
[5/17/2014 1:23:02 AM] Deano: i mean it
[5/17/2014 1:25:00 AM] Lucifer: i just feel really pathetic. :/
[5/17/2014 1:25:35 AM] Lucifer: i'm like literally setting up a fucking blog to rp with myself
[5/17/2014 1:26:36 AM] Lucifer: bc you have g and the only other metatron on tumblr dropped our thread. so yeah if i want metatron interactions with gabriel, i have to do it. bc there is no one else. :/
[5/17/2014 1:26:55 AM] Deano: you can play with my met
[5/17/2014 1:27:00 AM] Deano: he's probably going to suck tbh
[5/17/2014 1:27:56 AM] Lucifer: ;~;
[5/17/2014 1:37:03 AM] Lucifer: http://notgxd.tumblr.com/
[5/17/2014 1:44:37 AM] Deano: *follows*
[5/17/2014 1:45:03 AM] Lucifer: it's a crappy set up but eh
[5/17/2014 1:46:39 AM] Deano: (( *skips over anna dean sex scene bc ew* ))
[5/17/2014 1:46:46 AM] Deano: hush it's bootiful (heart)
[5/17/2014 1:47:01 AM] Lucifer: ;~;
[5/17/2014 1:47:15 AM] Lucifer: it'll do. i'm going to suck at writing him either way.
[5/17/2014 1:47:28 AM] Deano: we can suck together lol
[5/17/2014 1:47:36 AM] Lucifer: lmao
[5/17/2014 1:47:49 AM] Lucifer: i'm not even overly fond of the character but-
[5/17/2014 1:48:03 AM] Deano: same, there's just a severe lack of him
[5/17/2014 1:48:07 AM] Lucifer: i'm not putting much effort into his blog.
[5/17/2014 1:49:49 AM] Lucifer: i'm just thoroughly pissed and hurt, and honestly- idek.
[5/17/2014 1:50:42 AM] Deano: how come pissed?
[5/17/2014 1:51:06 AM] Lucifer: because i got my fucking thread dumped and replaced in the same stroke.
[5/17/2014 1:51:31 AM] Deano: by hint of mint
[5/17/2014 1:51:33 AM] Deano: ?
[5/17/2014 1:51:36 AM] Lucifer: yeah
[5/17/2014 1:52:15 AM] Lucifer: like idm doubles, but- when i was there first, and you blatantly drop my shit for a shittier gabriel, and on top of that- you lie to me? yea, no. fuck that shit.
[5/17/2014 1:53:07 AM] Deano: ;-;
[5/17/2014 1:53:12 AM] Lucifer: i shouldn't say shittier that's mean, but all the same.
[5/17/2014 1:53:36 AM] Deano: I haven't read any of his threads, I just played with him a tiny tiny bit on kali
[5/17/2014 1:53:42 AM] Deano: but yeah he seemed to jump that one gabe
[5/17/2014 1:54:56 AM] Lucifer: yeah i noticed. lol. after we already had a thread going. after i spent 3 hours on a fucking reply only for them to drop me without a word- and when i messaged her? she was like oh, no. not dropped! i'm working on it. well clearly you're not.
[5/17/2014 1:56:16 AM] Deano: ughhh
[5/17/2014 1:56:17 AM] Deano: r00d
[5/17/2014 1:56:34 AM] Lucifer: so yeah
[5/17/2014 1:57:20 AM] Lucifer: there's obvs something wrong with me. cause it keeps happening. i keep getting dropped/dumped/traded in whathaveyou.
[5/17/2014 1:57:44 AM] Deano: ;-; it's not you, it happens to everybody
[5/17/2014 1:58:40 AM] Deano: idk if that helps any
[5/17/2014 1:58:44 AM] Deano: but I can promise that you're not alone
[5/17/2014 2:01:47 AM] Lucifer: i'm obviously not doing any of my characters justice. because emily did the same thing. dropped all of our shit, dropped me, and replaced me with another lucifer and gabriel.
[5/17/2014 2:02:02 AM] Deano: gargles blood
[5/17/2014 2:02:06 AM] Deano: don't get me started on emily
[5/17/2014 2:02:28 AM] Lucifer: ;(
[5/17/2014 2:02:36 AM] Deano: are her and holly still best bros?
[5/17/2014 2:02:48 AM] Lucifer: i guess idk. it was holly that she replaced me with.
[5/17/2014 2:03:00 AM] Deano: have I ever bitched about holly before?
[5/17/2014 2:03:12 AM] Lucifer: i don't think so
[5/17/2014 2:03:40 AM] Deano: I legit have all her blogs blacklisted or at least try to she's always moving and changin url bc crazy
[5/17/2014 2:04:11 AM] Lucifer: lmfao she changes urls a lot. idk, her gabriel hasn't changed, as far as i know.
[5/17/2014 2:04:41 AM] Lucifer: idk that's a sore spot. bc as soon as she made one, emily got rid of me.
[5/17/2014 2:05:29 AM] Deano: last summer I met her and I was dean and she was buffy and we rp'd all the time and she was all YOU ARE MY FAVORITE DEAN LLALALA and we legit CREATED a RPG - but before it opened her Sam Winchester blog got super famous so she stopped rp'ing to and talking to me and replaced me and like she'd still be all YOU'RE MY FAVORITE but I'd see her telling it to like a billion different deans and just- ugh, she did the same thing to gabe too
[5/17/2014 2:05:39 AM] Deano: she's a cunt waffle and i'm never talking to her again
[5/17/2014 2:06:10 AM] Lucifer: ;~;
[5/17/2014 2:07:36 AM] Lucifer: i've never rp'd with holly. but she follows all of my blogs.
[5/17/2014 2:07:36 AM] Deano: 1000 flavors of done
[5/17/2014 2:07:55 AM] Deano: she's a really great writer, but she's full of shit lol
[5/17/2014 2:07:58 AM] Deano: her and emily were made for each other
[5/17/2014 2:08:05 AM] Lucifer: but after what emily did to me, i'm just done.
[5/17/2014 2:09:01 AM] Lucifer: like i get it. i suck. my character sucks. my writing sucks. everything sucks. idk, i honestly contemplated deletion at that point. i was that hurt. :/
[5/17/2014 2:09:16 AM] Deano: DUDE
[5/17/2014 2:09:20 AM] Deano: you seriously don't suck
[5/17/2014 2:09:22 AM] Deano: you're really good
[5/17/2014 2:09:42 AM] Deano: I'm not good enough to play with you tbh ;-; my replies are like turds compared to yours
[5/17/2014 2:10:04 AM] Deano: (( also omg i should shut this off bc i'm gonna cry- dean talking about hell ))
[5/17/2014 2:10:54 AM] Lucifer: ;~; i want to write with you. gabe doesn't get much interaction with other angels. :/
[5/17/2014 2:11:12 AM] Deano: *bounces on*
[5/17/2014 2:11:31 AM] Deano: This is my first real attempt to play an angel, I've dabbled in Cas rp but I really struggle with them for some reason
[5/17/2014 2:11:58 AM] Lucifer: You're doing good with anna so far.
[5/17/2014 2:12:21 AM] Lucifer: idrk her character that much, so i can't thoroughly comment but from what i've seen of her, she's good.
[5/17/2014 2:12:44 AM] Deano: i'm still re-watching things and trying to grasp her better
[5/17/2014 2:12:53 AM] Deano: I'm best at dean though, I've been playing him for years
[5/17/2014 2:13:00 AM] Deano: he's my precious bb
[5/17/2014 2:13:05 AM] Deano: *strokes him in a non-sexual way*
[5/17/2014 2:13:08 AM] Lucifer: (cat)
[5/17/2014 2:13:43 AM] Lucifer: lmfao i don't get to rp with many deans either. i've only really messed around with ash's. most don't bother with me.
[5/17/2014 2:13:57 AM] Deano: you can play with mine uvu
[5/17/2014 2:14:05 AM] Deano: *shoves all my characters at u*
[5/17/2014 2:14:10 AM] Lucifer: lmfao
[5/17/2014 2:15:16 AM] Lucifer: i mean, tbqh, my gabriel is a dick, so that's probably why. bc it seems like people prefer the softer ones. idk. mine's not that nice. hhhHHHhhh ; even when i try to force it, he still sounds like a dick.
[5/17/2014 2:15:58 AM] Deano: he shouldn't be soft lol
[5/17/2014 2:16:37 AM] Lucifer: lmfao he doesn't get along with many deans, bc most of them are rude out of the gate, so he gets RAWR.
[5/17/2014 2:16:44 AM] Deano: I haven't played with your Gabe yet, or read anything, so I don't have an opinion yet. But the only gabes I've found that I like so far are (the one I call mine uvu) and weeklyworldnews
[5/17/2014 2:16:59 AM] Deano: laughs he won't get along with my dean then, he's a supermassive dick LOL
[5/17/2014 2:17:03 AM] Deano: especially lately idk why
[5/17/2014 2:17:22 AM] Lucifer: lmao
[5/17/2014 2:17:50 AM] Deano: he can hold his own though
[5/17/2014 2:17:55 AM] Lucifer: that's good
[5/17/2014 2:18:10 AM] Deano: he's not a chicken lol
[5/17/2014 2:18:21 AM] Deano: he's p much like U WANNA GO, BITCH *swings around blade*
[5/17/2014 2:19:12 AM] Lucifer: if you've only found two that you like, you probably won't like mine. xD
[5/17/2014 2:19:49 AM] Deano: I probably will uvu
[5/17/2014 2:20:59 AM] Lucifer: idk, sometimes i feel like i make him too much of an ass. G tells me that it's fine and that she likes him, but- I still get kind of anxious over it. :/
[5/17/2014 2:22:19 AM] Deano: G?
[5/17/2014 2:22:34 AM] Lucifer: gabe ;
[5/17/2014 2:22:47 AM] Deano: mine? xD
[5/17/2014 2:22:59 AM] Lucifer: yea-
[5/17/2014 2:23:09 AM] Deano: I have the memory of a goldfish and it's 3:30 rn so I also have the intelligence of one
[5/17/2014 2:23:26 AM] Deano: don't tell her I told you, but she's really nervous that I'm going to replace her with you
[5/17/2014 2:23:45 AM] Lucifer: but why? i would never take you from her. :/
[5/17/2014 2:24:07 AM] Deano: You're a lovely writer, and I like you a lot, but I'm v attatched to her and I've been trying to explain it lol
[5/17/2014 2:24:48 AM] Lucifer: I've told her that I wouldn't do that to her.
[5/17/2014 2:24:53 AM] Lucifer: idk why she would think that.
[5/17/2014 2:24:59 AM] Lucifer: you wouldn't do that either
[5/17/2014 2:25:10 AM] Deano: her and I are both a little messed up and we get jealous easy and we're both super stubborn lol
[5/17/2014 2:25:21 AM] Deano: we've also decided we're too much like gabe and kali which is why we've been fighting lately
[5/17/2014 2:25:30 AM] Lucifer: lmao
[5/17/2014 2:26:04 AM] Lucifer: she has absolutely zero reason to be jealous or threatened by me.
[5/17/2014 2:26:56 AM] Deano: sometimes even with no reason the feelings are still there, I struggle with it - mostly bc ex girlfriend who was an rp partner shit bleh
[5/17/2014 2:27:06 AM] Lucifer: :(
[5/17/2014 2:28:35 AM] Deano: I'm okay now, but it was stressfull for a long time and I still get like- her and I played destiel and then she p much stopped playing with me to play with this sam (who is a total dick, and she even admits that he's a dick ooc and just ugh) so now I have to blacklist sam/cas stuff because it makes me sick and I've had to blacklist sam/gabe stuff too because the anxiety transfered xD
[5/17/2014 2:28:52 AM] Lucifer: :(
[5/17/2014 2:29:20 AM] Deano: no sad faces, i'm mostly okay now
[5/17/2014 2:29:29 AM] Lucifer: i'm sorry
[5/17/2014 2:29:42 AM] Deano: shit happens lol
[5/17/2014 2:30:07 AM] Lucifer: i feel your pain.
[5/17/2014 2:30:55 AM] Deano: ;-;
[5/17/2014 2:34:01 AM] Lucifer: tbh that's why i've been so hesitant to ask you to play with me bc idk, i feel guilty i guess, bc of G- because i don't want her to feel threatened by me or bear ill feelings toward me even though i remind her constantly that she's amazing and she's better than she believes herself to be. i just throw up jargon and half-the-time ide think it sounds like gabriel, but- she's brilliant. i just hate that she feels so insecure.
[5/17/2014 2:34:53 AM] Deano: I hate it too ;-; because she really is great but no matter how many times people say it she doesn't listen
[5/17/2014 2:36:14 AM] Lucifer: like, i literally only follow two gabriels. and she's one of them. bc i'm so goddamn picky about the way he's portrayed that most of them i either blacklist or discredit.
[5/17/2014 2:36:39 AM] Lucifer: i follow her and nuntixs. and fugitivuus before they went inactive.
[5/17/2014 2:36:42 AM] Lucifer: that's literally it.
[5/17/2014 2:36:57 AM] Deano: like 99% of gabriel's out there are just bad idek how
[5/17/2014 2:37:03 AM] Deano: so few good ones
[5/17/2014 2:37:16 AM] Lucifer: yeah there aren't many good ones
[5/17/2014 2:38:38 AM] Deano: I talked to fugitivuus a little bit
[5/17/2014 2:38:44 AM] Deano: a long ass time ago
[5/17/2014 2:38:51 AM] Lucifer: yeah xD they were good
[5/17/2014 2:38:54 AM] Lucifer: i liked them. (cat)
[5/17/2014 2:39:03 AM] Deano: they were nice, yus
[5/17/2014 2:39:06 AM] Lucifer: it sucks that they went inactive.
[5/17/2014 2:39:20 AM] Deano: yeah :c
[5/17/2014 2:39:48 AM] Lucifer: their gabe was gr9
[5/17/2014 2:40:28 AM] Deano: he was uvu
[5/17/2014 2:41:55 AM] Lucifer: everyone likes witness's idk why tho. she's really not that good, i mean she's a good writer but her gabriel is too soft, imo. :/
[5/17/2014 2:42:54 AM] Deano: yeah, she posts too much lol
[5/17/2014 2:43:06 AM] Deano: I followed for awhile and then I changed to not following any gabriels
[5/17/2014 2:43:31 AM] Deano: the only other one I followed was WWN because her and I are great friends irl and she's one of the first people I ever rp'd with so G understood
[5/17/2014 2:43:53 AM] Lucifer: yeah, i get that.
[5/17/2014 2:44:08 AM] Deano: it's her and yourstorynotours's fault that I even started shipping Kali Gabe lol
[5/17/2014 2:44:21 AM] Deano: then I met my gabe and was like WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS THING AND YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE IT
[5/17/2014 2:44:31 AM] Lucifer: lmfao awwwwwwww
[5/17/2014 2:44:58 AM] Deano: i regret nothing
[5/17/2014 2:46:11 AM] Lucifer: xD i like G's gabriel, she's awesome. tbh she's one of the few that actually captures his voice correctly- most don't. gabriel has a particular nuance to the way he speaks, and the vast majority of gabriels can't do it justice. i like that she does.
[5/17/2014 2:46:42 AM] Deano: me too, she's mah bb
[5/17/2014 2:46:55 AM] Deano: I'm totally in love with her lmao
[5/17/2014 2:46:59 AM] Lucifer: awwwww (cat)
[5/17/2014 2:47:30 AM] Deano: the cat decided to sit on my laptop so getting on cell xD
[5/17/2014 2:47:40 AM] Lucifer: ahahaha okay
[5/17/2014 2:48:39 AM] Deano: (kiss)
[5/17/2014 2:49:42 AM] Lucifer: (cat)
[5/17/2014 2:50:36 AM] Deano: G and my Sam don't like each other and it sucks bc I adore them both
[5/17/2014 2:50:47 AM] Lucifer: lmao awwwww ;~;
[5/17/2014 2:53:13 AM] Lucifer: it's sad idr have mains. xD nobody stays long enough to call them one. except for aria, that is. and ash. that's about it. :x
[5/17/2014 2:54:02 AM] Deano: Who does ash play? ( memory of goldfish)
[5/17/2014 2:54:26 AM] Lucifer: Ash is my main Dean.
[5/17/2014 2:54:47 AM] Deano: I should have remembered that. I'm so bad with names omg
[5/17/2014 2:54:53 AM] Lucifer: she's the only one i've really interacted with.
[5/17/2014 2:54:53 AM] Deano: What's their URL?
[5/17/2014 2:54:57 AM] Lucifer: raisedhunter
[5/17/2014 2:55:14 AM] Deano: I've seen them around uvu
[5/17/2014 2:55:35 AM] Deano: I hardly ever follow deans bc they make me nervous that my dead sucks lol
[5/17/2014 2:56:18 AM] Lucifer: yeah xD she's my bae. total sweetheart (cat) your dean is good from what i've seen of him.  xD
[5/17/2014 2:58:15 AM] Deano: I'm really proud of mine lol
[5/17/2014 2:58:46 AM] Lucifer: xD
[5/17/2014 2:59:12 AM] Lucifer: i know we followed each other for awhile. but we never interacted.
[5/17/2014 2:59:48 AM] Deano: Probs bc I'm slow as fuck haha
[5/17/2014 2:59:50 AM] Lucifer: which is a shame bc i love your writing
[5/17/2014 3:01:41 AM] Deano: ;A;
[5/17/2014 3:01:48 AM] Deano: *heavy breathes for awhile*
[5/17/2014 3:02:48 AM] Lucifer: lmao why the heavy breathing? xD
[5/17/2014 3:04:17 AM] Deano: Bc you're writing is amazing
[5/17/2014 3:04:31 AM] Deano: Your wtf autocorrect
[5/17/2014 3:04:57 AM] Lucifer: lmfao i don't think i'm that good.
[5/17/2014 3:05:08 AM] Deano: I do *_*
[5/17/2014 3:05:52 AM] Lucifer: i just ramble a lot and use big words. most of it doesn't even make any sense.
[5/17/2014 3:06:03 AM] Deano: I enjoy it
[5/17/2014 3:06:27 AM] Lucifer: :)
[5/17/2014 3:06:46 AM] Deano: (( I hate the dean / Anna ship lol ))
[5/17/2014 3:07:22 AM] Lucifer: lmfao yeah same
[5/17/2014 3:10:03 AM] Deano: I hope deans don't avoid me bc they assume I wanna ship bc I for sure do not
[5/17/2014 3:10:18 AM] Lucifer: :(
[5/17/2014 3:12:10 AM] Lucifer: lmao most ignore me bc i don't. i don't ship sabriel or debriel (romantically) and very sparingly non-romantically, save a few where there's actual chemistry; i don't have a lot of interactions with the main three for the basic reason that i don't ship. other than kalibriel with aria, but that's really it. i'm picky as fuck when it comes to shipping-
[5/17/2014 3:13:33 AM] Deano: I ship most things but am too lazy to sit down and play them most of my shipping is done like 1x1 on skype or KIK
[5/17/2014 3:13:57 AM] Deano: I keep trying to actually reply to my Buffy on tumblr lol
[5/17/2014 3:15:24 AM] Lucifer: i'm fairly certain that's half the reason why emily dropped me, on both accounts. she tried to get me to ship balcifer and i couldn't do it.... i just don't see it tbh. lucifer wouldn't have anything to do with balthazar. he's too low-ranking of an angel. he barely recognized castiel, called him a curious thing, but Cas is also a Seraph, so- in the same general rung as an archangel, just a step below.
[5/17/2014 3:15:58 AM] Deano: Ugh
[5/17/2014 3:15:59 AM] Lucifer: and on top of that, lucifer just isn't a sexual angel.
[5/17/2014 3:16:23 AM] Lucifer: so it felt very awkward for me to write it.
[5/17/2014 3:16:24 AM] Deano: I hate that she bitches about how much she hates dean then makes a dean account
[5/17/2014 3:16:31 AM] Deano: nO stay away from my bb
[5/17/2014 3:17:05 AM] Lucifer: lmfao i know. she's such a fucking hypocrite.
[5/17/2014 3:17:08 AM] Deano: Nobody should force you to ship, that's like the first rule of rp
[5/17/2014 3:17:20 AM] Deano: Apparently she hates Gabe too??? And I just
[5/17/2014 3:17:47 AM] Lucifer: lmfao she does. that's a reason she gave me that she couldn't rp with me. yet, she made all the verses with holly-
[5/17/2014 3:17:54 AM] Deano: And she's kind of an elitist
[5/17/2014 3:18:03 AM] Lucifer: i just don't think she liked my gabriel, in general.
[5/17/2014 3:18:35 AM] Lucifer: bc she told me that she lost our thread, and then in a skype call it came out that gabriel reacted different than balthazar would've liked, so she dumped the thread.
[5/17/2014 3:18:47 AM] Deano: Jesus fucking Christ
[5/17/2014 3:19:02 AM] Deano: So glad I ran away from all that
[5/17/2014 3:19:17 AM] Lucifer: she dumped aria's cas too, said that her cas was too much of a dick.
[5/17/2014 3:19:31 AM] Deano: Gargles blood
[5/17/2014 3:19:36 AM] Lucifer: :/
[5/17/2014 3:19:41 AM] Lucifer: yeah
[5/17/2014 3:19:53 AM] Deano: She's na hath right?
[5/17/2014 3:19:58 AM] Lucifer: she is
[5/17/2014 3:19:59 AM] Lucifer: (cat)
[5/17/2014 3:20:16 AM] Deano: I follow her on most my accounts lol
[5/17/2014 3:20:24 AM] Lucifer: she's a wonderful cas.
[5/17/2014 3:20:38 AM] Lucifer: like yeah he is a dick, but he's also season 6 and cas was a dick in season 6.
[5/17/2014 3:20:50 AM] Lucifer: emily just wanted ship crap
[5/17/2014 3:21:09 AM] Deano: Fuck dat ship crap not everything should be about shipping
[5/17/2014 3:22:19 AM] Lucifer: ikr
[5/17/2014 3:23:28 AM] Deano: Blehhh
[5/17/2014 3:23:35 AM] Deano: Thank god for tumblr savior
[5/17/2014 3:24:01 AM] Deano: She followed my dean with Balthazar and I was like *laughs forever and ignores* I don't need that shit in my life
[5/17/2014 3:24:07 AM] Lucifer: i had a mercury try and ship with me and i was like..... like, they automatically assumed i was going to ship and i was like "lol, no. not even brotp dude, sorry. cause i mean- 1.) my gabriel is a dick, so brotping takes chemistry and 2.) he and mercury? i really don't see that tbh. i don't see him being all that fond of mercury.
[5/17/2014 3:24:18 AM] Lucifer: lmfao when did she follow you?
[5/17/2014 3:24:48 AM] Deano: Awhile ago I checked today and she must have unfollowed bc I didn't follow back
[5/17/2014 3:25:01 AM] Deano: Wtf mercury omg
[5/17/2014 3:25:11 AM] Lucifer: she deleted her bart bc of me. and moved her balthazar because aria made one.
[5/17/2014 3:25:32 AM] Deano: I think my kali met mercury. She scared him. Rightfully so lil shit
[5/17/2014 3:25:32 AM] Lucifer: she got really passive aggressive toward me for making a bart.
[5/17/2014 3:25:43 AM] Deano: Does she have a Bart?
[5/17/2014 3:25:46 AM] Lucifer: she did.
[5/17/2014 3:25:51 AM] Deano: Ah
[5/17/2014 3:25:53 AM] Deano: Yeah
[5/17/2014 3:26:05 AM] Deano: She also gets the title cunt waffle
[5/17/2014 3:26:17 AM] Deano: I'll make her and holly crowns
[5/17/2014 3:26:17 AM] Lucifer: she deleted him, after she lamented about it on the dash, about how season 9 has ruined him and such, coincidentally right after i posted my starters.
[5/17/2014 3:26:23 AM] Lucifer: on him
[5/17/2014 3:26:33 AM] Deano: Cunt. Waffle.
[5/17/2014 3:26:49 AM] Deano: ( my new favorite insult)
[5/17/2014 3:26:51 AM] Lucifer: and then she tried laying claim to aria on skype and asked me if i wanted her icons. and tried to school me on how to play him.
[5/17/2014 3:26:54 AM] Lucifer: i'm like-
[5/17/2014 3:27:05 AM] Deano: What the fuck
[5/17/2014 3:27:12 AM] Lucifer: yea
[5/17/2014 3:27:18 AM] Lucifer: she never talks to me on skype
[5/17/2014 3:27:20 AM] Lucifer: never
[5/17/2014 3:27:29 AM] Deano: I think I deleted her lol
[5/17/2014 3:27:31 AM] Lucifer: and pops up out of the blue and asks if i want her bart icons
[5/17/2014 3:27:35 AM] Lucifer: which she never gave me
[5/17/2014 3:28:00 AM] Deano: Uhg don't take her icons they probably have diseases
[5/17/2014 3:28:25 AM] Deano: ( I'm being a cunt waffle tonight. Lol.)
[5/17/2014 3:28:28 AM] Lucifer: and we got on the subject of bart and i was like, yeah- i'm nervous and she was like "he's easy. all you have to do is act better than everyone and only be submissive with naomi, but that isn't canon and that was mine and aria's thing."
[5/17/2014 3:28:31 AM] Lucifer: i'm like.........
[5/17/2014 3:28:42 AM] Lucifer: lmfao i already have alot.
[5/17/2014 3:28:46 AM] Lucifer: elena made some for me
[5/17/2014 3:28:49 AM] Lucifer: :x
[5/17/2014 3:28:50 AM] Deano: D :
[5/17/2014 3:28:50 AM] Lucifer: (cat)
[5/17/2014 3:29:05 AM] Deano: Idk who Elena is lol
[5/17/2014 3:29:11 AM] Lucifer: i did make bart as sort of a stab at emily-
[5/17/2014 3:29:38 AM] Lucifer: bc she posted on tumblr earlier that week, saying that she wanted a bart to rp with but nobody could write him like she could.
[5/17/2014 3:29:54 AM] Deano: If I thought I'd be any good at Balthazar id do it to spite her
[5/17/2014 3:30:02 AM] Deano: And I'd make the URL yourjudas
[5/17/2014 3:30:16 AM] Lucifer: a lucifer offered and she was like "i really wished you wouldn't because nobody would be able to do him the justice that i can or meet the expectations i have for him."
[5/17/2014 3:30:18 AM] Lucifer: so
[5/17/2014 3:30:20 AM] Lucifer: i made one
[5/17/2014 3:30:41 AM] Deano: WOW
[5/17/2014 3:30:44 AM] Lucifer: and apparently it pissed her off
[5/17/2014 3:30:48 AM] Deano: Said that on tumblr?
[5/17/2014 3:30:53 AM] Lucifer: she did
[5/17/2014 3:31:13 AM] Deano: AND PEOPLE DONT THINK SHES A CUNT WAFFLE? Everybody thinks rainbows fly out of her ass
[5/17/2014 3:31:17 AM] Deano: God this is awful
[5/17/2014 3:31:37 AM] Lucifer: lmfao apparently. she's an elitist bitch.
[5/17/2014 3:32:04 AM] Lucifer: aria made a balthazar and she threw a fit over it.
[5/17/2014 3:32:20 AM] Deano: You and me and aria and Gabe should make a goddam cult like she did but not be cunt waffles
[5/17/2014 3:32:37 AM] Deano: And actually play with people and allow them to feel good about themselves
[5/17/2014 3:32:45 AM] Deano: And then punch her in the throat
[5/17/2014 3:32:49 AM] Lucifer: lmfao we should. lmfao. the emily hate fanclub.
[5/17/2014 3:33:01 AM] Deano: It's 4:30am and now I'm just angry lol
[5/17/2014 3:33:16 AM] Lucifer: tbh i think she felt threatened by my writing.
[5/17/2014 3:33:23 AM] Deano: Laughs I wanna but we also shouldn't stoop to her level
[5/17/2014 3:33:27 AM] Lucifer: bc i am a better writer than she is.
[5/17/2014 3:33:35 AM] Deano: I'm sure she does uvu
[5/17/2014 3:33:43 AM] Deano: You are c:
[5/17/2014 3:33:49 AM] Lucifer: and i think it pissed her off that i write bart better than her. <.<
[5/17/2014 3:33:58 AM] Deano: Cackles
[5/17/2014 3:34:07 AM] Lucifer: i almost made a balthazar tbh
[5/17/2014 3:34:12 AM] Lucifer: just to spite her
[5/17/2014 3:34:16 AM] Lucifer: but aria made one
[5/17/2014 3:34:58 AM] Deano: Good
[5/17/2014 3:35:22 AM] Lucifer: lmao
[5/17/2014 3:35:36 AM] Lucifer: I think I could've given her a run for her money.
[5/17/2014 3:35:45 AM] Deano: You could have
[5/17/2014 3:36:02 AM] Deano: She would have been pissed and probably threatened to delete for attention
[5/17/2014 3:36:09 AM] Deano: I can't stand it when people do that
[5/17/2014 3:36:13 AM] Lucifer: lmfao she would have. xD if aria deletes, i might.
[5/17/2014 3:36:23 AM] Lucifer: just to piss her the fuck off.
[5/17/2014 3:36:32 AM] Deano: Heh
[5/17/2014 3:37:02 AM] Lucifer: because my writing is more advanced than hers, and i could probably do just as well with his voicing and character ticks.
[5/17/2014 3:37:18 AM] Deano: Agree
[5/17/2014 3:37:27 AM] Deano: Plus you're not a cunt waffle
[5/17/2014 3:37:34 AM] Lucifer: lmao she would feel threatened by me.
[5/17/2014 3:37:58 AM] Lucifer: and i would lurk her page just to see all her bitching.
[5/17/2014 3:38:00 AM] Lucifer: xD
[5/17/2014 3:38:00 AM] Deano: She's so annoying lol
[5/17/2014 3:38:23 AM] Deano: I'm just I can't believe her and holly fucking found each other
[5/17/2014 3:38:37 AM] Lucifer: lmfao i know. they're soulmates tbh
[5/17/2014 3:38:49 AM] Deano: And holly bitches about not having a dean YOU DONT HAVE A DEAN BC YOURE AN EVIL TURD MUFFIN
[5/17/2014 3:38:54 AM] Deano: I'm still bitter
[5/17/2014 3:39:00 AM] Lucifer: lmfao
[5/17/2014 3:39:03 AM] Deano: I should get over it but I hold grudges forever
[5/17/2014 3:39:09 AM] Lucifer: emily bitches about not having any cas'
[5/17/2014 3:39:11 AM] Lucifer: and i'm like
[5/17/2014 3:39:14 AM] Lucifer: you fucking got three
[5/17/2014 3:39:25 AM] Deano: Nobody needs three
[5/17/2014 3:39:35 AM] Lucifer: ikr?
[5/17/2014 3:39:59 AM] Deano: Like I have two Gabes that are /mine/ but I only RP with G and just ooc talk with the other
[5/17/2014 3:40:19 AM] Lucifer: yeah ahaha xD
[5/17/2014 3:40:56 AM] Deano: I can RP with your gabe tho uvu especially because we won't be doing shippy things lol
[5/17/2014 3:41:08 AM] Lucifer: ahahaha
[5/17/2014 3:41:36 AM] Deano: I feel bad because I really want to change metatrons face but I hate it when people change fcs
[5/17/2014 3:41:43 AM] Deano: Like of canon characters
[5/17/2014 3:41:45 AM] Lucifer: lmfao
[5/17/2014 3:41:49 AM] Deano: And I'd be a total hypocrite
[5/17/2014 3:41:56 AM] Deano: But god his face is so annoying
[5/17/2014 3:42:00 AM] Lucifer: it is
[5/17/2014 3:43:02 AM] Deano: G made me make a tumblr because when we first met I played him a little on skype and it was before season 9 and he basically just fucked with Gabes mind and made him see shit and think that dean was torturing him and stuff
[5/17/2014 3:43:08 AM] Deano: It was fun uvu
[5/17/2014 3:43:17 AM] Lucifer: ahahahaha
[5/17/2014 3:43:23 AM] Deano: But it's probably going to mean my met will end up kinda ooc
[5/17/2014 3:43:27 AM] Lucifer: yeah xD
[5/17/2014 3:43:43 AM] Deano: Oh well lol
[5/17/2014 3:43:44 AM] Lucifer: mine is going to suck.
[5/17/2014 3:44:07 AM] Deano: I'm not very impressed by hint of mints <.>
[5/17/2014 3:44:23 AM] Lucifer: ahahaha hintofmints isn't that good they're too ooc
[5/17/2014 3:44:25 AM] Deano: I've only rp'd with them a tiny bit tho
[5/17/2014 3:44:41 AM] Deano: OMG so random funny story
[5/17/2014 3:46:06 AM] Deano: G and I got into a huge fight and I was really really pissed so I made a new Kali account and followed a couple Gabes bc I was very angry lol. I instantly regretted it of course and deleted like five minutes later. But. After the fight we started talking and she confessed to making a Gabe account and not telling me and it was one of the ones I followed
[5/17/2014 3:46:35 AM] Lucifer: lmao ahahahaha yeah xD i rp her meta!gabe.
[5/17/2014 3:46:37 AM] Lucifer: xD
[5/17/2014 3:46:49 AM] Deano: And then I re made the kali bc I liked the URL. Plus I've been struggling with married kali lately bc g has been struggling with that Gabe
[5/17/2014 3:47:06 AM] Lucifer: ;~;
[5/17/2014 3:47:15 AM] Lucifer: maybe starting new will help
[5/17/2014 3:47:23 AM] Deano: She didn't tell me for like a month 😩 I was a little butt hurt
[5/17/2014 3:47:30 AM] Lucifer: :(
[5/17/2014 3:47:37 AM] Deano: I don't think we're gonna ship there
[5/17/2014 3:48:07 AM] Lucifer: sometimes ships can be volatile
[5/17/2014 3:48:26 AM] Deano: For a little while it felt like she just hated my Kali and I think that's why I picked fights
[5/17/2014 3:48:40 AM] Deano: I take those things personally even tho I shouldn't
[5/17/2014 3:48:58 AM] Lucifer: she always loved her kali
[5/17/2014 3:49:22 AM] Deano: We haven't done kali Gabe in a long time
[5/17/2014 3:49:45 AM] Deano: We're planning a new human au tho for KIK so hopefully that works out
[5/17/2014 3:49:48 AM] Lucifer: ;~;
[5/17/2014 3:49:55 AM] Lucifer: that will be cool
[5/17/2014 3:50:05 AM] Deano: I hope so 😩
[5/17/2014 3:50:13 AM] Deano: I don't really get to play kali anywhere else
[5/17/2014 3:50:16 AM] Lucifer: :D
[5/17/2014 3:51:10 AM] Deano: But yeah it's just been so hard lately
[5/17/2014 3:51:15 AM] Deano: Idk what's been with us
[5/17/2014 3:51:17 AM] Lucifer: :(
[5/17/2014 3:51:25 AM] Lucifer: sometimes shit just gets difficult.
[5/17/2014 3:51:27 AM] Deano: We never used to fight and just tiny things set us off
[5/17/2014 3:51:53 AM] Lucifer: hopefully the talk has helped.
[5/17/2014 3:52:05 AM] Deano: Tbh we're like a couple <.< but we're not actually dating bc she's straight and in a different country
[5/17/2014 3:52:16 AM] Deano: Things have been good today
[5/17/2014 3:52:27 AM] Lucifer: lmao well that's good. (cat)

[5/17/2014 3:53:57 AM] Lucifer: my mood crash and my writing muse went with it.
[5/17/2014 3:53:57 AM] Deano: I'm done with school lol the only thing I have to deal with tomorrow is family
[5/17/2014 3:54:14 AM] Deano: Hate it when that happens ;-;
[5/17/2014 3:54:26 AM] Lucifer: it does that a lot, unfortunately.
[5/17/2014 3:54:42 AM] Lucifer: my confidence is horribly shaky.
[5/17/2014 3:54:50 AM] Deano: I'm in the same boat -hugs face and gives a life vest-
[5/17/2014 3:55:30 AM] Lucifer: I just don't really think I do any of my characters justice. I think people just lie to me for the sake of making me feel better. :/
[5/17/2014 3:55:54 AM] Deano: I'm usually painfully honest
[5/17/2014 3:56:13 AM] Deano: And your writing is amazing
[5/17/2014 3:56:38 AM] Lucifer: yeah but good writing doesn't mean that i capture my characters right.
[5/17/2014 3:56:47 AM] Lucifer: i could be fucking them up for all i know
[5/17/2014 3:57:12 AM] Deano: I don't think so uvu
[5/17/2014 3:57:15 AM] Deano: (kiss)
[5/17/2014 3:57:36 AM] Lucifer: you haven't read anything of mine.
[5/17/2014 3:58:18 AM] Deano: We rp'd a little when we first met
[5/17/2014 3:58:39 AM] Deano: I think I still have a reply in my drafts from like 2 months ago cause I suck balls

[5/19/2014 9:04:02 PM] Lucifer: unless you're wiling to start it. but i'm terrible at starting things out. :/
[5/19/2014 9:04:46 PM] Deano: it's probably going to end up a little cracky bc I'm in a mood lol
[5/19/2014 9:10:31 PM] Lucifer: idk if i'm in the mood for crack bc i'm sort of irritated at myself now
[5/19/2014 9:10:47 PM] Deano: ;-; aww

[5/19/2014 9:30:40 PM] Deano: wow I'm out of it then
[5/19/2014 9:31:33 PM] Deano: I've been account hopping hardcore
[5/19/2014 9:31:46 PM] Lucifer: it's fine. i'm just going to work on my drawing. we don't have to do anything. but we've never rp'd on my gabriel account and we haven't rp'd in awhile so i thought- idk. don't worry about it.
[5/19/2014 9:32:06 PM] Deano: It's posted
[5/19/2014 9:32:24 PM] Deano: (( G keeps getting rid of the URLs and it's driving my OCD insane but I don't wanna say too much bc we don't need another fight ))
[5/19/2014 9:32:45 PM] Lucifer: getting rid of urls?
[5/19/2014 9:33:02 PM] Deano: yeah gets rid of my url when she reblogs the post so there's no urls on the post
[5/19/2014 9:33:15 PM] Lucifer: oooooo
[5/19/2014 9:33:24 PM] Deano: it's really annoying
[5/19/2014 9:33:25 PM] Deano: lol
[5/19/2014 9:33:34 PM] Deano: I hope more people don't start doing it omg
[5/19/2014 9:34:08 PM] Lucifer: I don't. Because I tag stuff with urls.
[5/19/2014 9:34:21 PM] Lucifer: and i'm sorry about my mood. it's been shitty lately.
[5/19/2014 9:34:32 PM] Lucifer: i just feel like i'm in everybody's way
[5/19/2014 9:34:43 PM] Lucifer: idk i think there's something clinically wrong with me
[5/19/2014 9:35:41 PM] Deano: You don't have to apologize, I never meant to make you feel worse or anything. And, I understand. I suffer from depression and anxiety too, so I'm here if you want to talk. Always.
[5/19/2014 9:36:43 PM] Lucifer: if i'm not crying- i feel like i'm going to cry. i feel like people just put up with me and nobody actually wants me around.
[5/19/2014 9:37:04 PM] Deano: That's not true, darling. I think you're awesome, and lots of other people do too.
[5/19/2014 9:39:33 PM] Lucifer: I don't feel that way. I haven't for awhile. :/
[5/19/2014 9:40:27 PM] Deano: Do you have anyone IRL to talk to about it?
[5/19/2014 9:40:40 PM] Lucifer: no i don't
[5/19/2014 9:42:34 PM] Deano: crap ;-;
[5/19/2014 9:44:16 PM] Lucifer: eh
[5/19/2014 9:45:25 PM] Deano: Well, I'm not much, but I'm here. (heart)
[5/19/2014 9:45:42 PM] Deano: I never judge, no matter what.
[5/19/2014 9:47:58 PM] Lucifer: thanks... i'm just... i've felt so inadequate lately. :(
[5/19/2014 9:50:56 PM] Deano: Do you know if there's a reason?
[5/19/2014 9:51:24 PM] Lucifer: for feeling inadequate? yeah i do.
[5/19/2014 9:52:47 PM] Deano: Do you wanna talk about it?
[5/19/2014 9:56:23 PM] Lucifer: I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough anymore. I feel like.... like I'm just this replacable, irrelevant person- and that sooner or later people are going to drop me and move on. Threads, friendship, whatever. And it bugs me. Because I used to pour so much heart into my writing and now I feel that drive slipping because nobody's ever invested in me. They always find something better. Or someone better. And I get forgotten. Always. ;(
[5/19/2014 9:57:02 PM] Deano: What about your Kali?
[5/19/2014 9:58:49 PM] Lucifer: she hasn't yet.
[5/19/2014 9:59:09 PM] Lucifer: but people always do
[5/19/2014 10:00:08 PM] Deano: I don't plan on leaving again.
[5/19/2014 10:03:22 PM] Lucifer: ;~; yeah but we don't really rp either. i mean we talk. but you can't exactly replace me because you're not mine.
[5/19/2014 10:04:19 PM] Deano: I'd like to RP more though
[5/19/2014 10:05:00 PM] Deano: like we've rp'd a tiny bit
[5/19/2014 10:05:30 PM] Lucifer: I've wanted to rp with you for awhile but you never seemed interested. And at the time, my Lucifer muse was selective at best. :/
[5/19/2014 10:06:05 PM] Deano: I was just busy as fuck, I have a few weeks before work really starts again so we should RP before I have to leave
[5/19/2014 10:06:35 PM] Lucifer: ;~;
[5/19/2014 10:06:57 PM] Lucifer: well you don't have to respond right away for threads
[5/19/2014 10:07:19 PM] Deano: then let's do things and stuff
[5/19/2014 10:07:23 PM] Deano: *perches on*
[5/19/2014 10:08:45 PM] Lucifer: I'm about to post back to anna
[5/19/2014 10:08:59 PM] Deano: yay!
[5/19/2014 10:09:25 PM] Lucifer: it's shitty and i'm scared of disappointing you. ;~;
[5/19/2014 10:09:37 PM] Deano: YOU WON'T
[5/19/2014 10:09:40 PM] Deano: YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
[5/19/2014 10:09:55 PM] Lucifer: LOL well....
[5/19/2014 10:12:40 PM] Lucifer: did anna die before or after raphael?
[5/19/2014 10:12:52 PM] Deano: I'll look it up one sec
[5/19/2014 10:13:07 PM] Lucifer:  "If I were trying to hide, you wouldn't have found me.

                                        ----what're you, here on Raphael's behalf?"
[5/19/2014 10:13:13 PM] Lucifer: that's what i have- but

[5/20/2014 5:29:09 PM] Lucifer: i'm a hypocrite lmfao i build her up but tear myself down because i don't have any confidence of my own---- but i do mean what i say to her, i'm not just saying it to make her feel good.
[5/20/2014 5:30:30 PM] Deano: I mean what I say to you too
[5/20/2014 5:32:06 PM] Lucifer: -nuzz- I'm trying to be more confident. It's not so much my writing, my writing is fine, it's the voicing that I worry about, if it sounds off, or if i'm getting it down right, etc.
[5/20/2014 5:32:46 PM] Deano: I think it's spot on
[5/20/2014 5:33:04 PM] Lucifer: really? ;n;
[5/20/2014 5:33:09 PM] Lucifer: -nuzz-
[5/20/2014 5:33:44 PM] Lucifer: lmao i'm so fucking meticulous with his dialogue. xD
[5/20/2014 5:36:23 PM] Deano: I loves it
[5/20/2014 5:36:34 PM] Deano: (( Making Kali icons bc drinking and don't wanna focus lol ))
[5/20/2014 5:36:44 PM] Deano: (( I also wish that baldur would come back ;-; ))
[5/20/2014 5:40:47 PM] Lucifer: ahahaha I do too.
[5/20/2014 5:40:56 PM] Lucifer: they followed me once
[5/20/2014 5:41:00 PM] Lucifer: and went inactive
[5/20/2014 5:42:25 PM] Lucifer: it's a shame bc they were good
[5/20/2014 5:43:47 PM] Deano: agree
[5/20/2014 5:44:28 PM] Lucifer: all the pagans are in short supply
[5/20/2014 5:46:15 PM] Lucifer: ;~;
[5/20/2014 5:46:35 PM] Lucifer: would be nice to see a Ganesh
[5/20/2014 5:46:47 PM] Lucifer: I'm sure I butchered that name-
[5/20/2014 5:47:45 PM] Deano: I think you spelled it right!
[5/20/2014 5:47:50 PM] Deano: Yeah, that would be cool
[5/20/2014 5:47:59 PM] Deano: I want all the gods yus
[5/20/2014 5:48:25 PM] Lucifer: same. we only really saw kali, mercury and baldur.
[5/20/2014 5:49:24 PM] Lucifer: i know, historically speaking, according to norse lore, there is history tied in between baldur and loki-- like rivalry or some shit. but yeah. it would be nice if they expanded on some of those things.
[5/20/2014 5:50:55 PM] Deano: yes yes
[5/20/2014 5:50:57 PM] Deano: all the things
[5/20/2014 5:51:02 PM] Deano: I had a dream they brought Kali back
[5/20/2014 5:51:07 PM] Deano: and when I woke up I was super sad lol
[5/20/2014 5:51:17 PM] Lucifer: ;n; they should.
[5/20/2014 5:51:22 PM] Lucifer: kali was a very good character
[5/20/2014 5:53:39 PM] Deano: yes yes
[5/20/2014 5:53:45 PM] Deano: one of my favorites evr
[5/20/2014 5:53:48 PM] Deano: plus rekha sharma nggn
[5/20/2014 5:54:07 PM] Lucifer: she's gr9
[5/20/2014 5:54:10 PM] Lucifer: i love her
[5/20/2014 5:54:14 PM] Lucifer: such good acting
[5/20/2014 5:56:04 PM] Deano: yourstorynotours got to meet her
[5/20/2014 5:56:06 PM] Deano: so jelaous
[5/20/2014 5:57:44 PM] Lucifer: awwwww was she at a con?
[5/20/2014 5:58:00 PM] Deano: I think so uvu
[5/20/2014 5:58:15 PM] Deano: She talked to her about Kali and stuff and Rekha confirmed that Kali was in looove with Gabriel
[5/20/2014 5:59:11 PM] Lucifer: Yeah, I think I saw that somewhere. It makes sense, considering her entire speech was talking herself up enough to kill him, make herself angry enough to do it.
[5/20/2014 5:59:59 PM] Deano: and just her face
[5/20/2014 6:00:03 PM] Deano: after she does it
[5/20/2014 6:00:07 PM] Deano: and when she finds out he's alive
[5/20/2014 6:00:08 PM] Deano: uGH
[5/20/2014 6:00:12 PM] Deano: I have so many feelings
[5/20/2014 6:00:32 PM] Lucifer: I know. ;~;
[5/20/2014 6:00:42 PM] Deano: nobody ever wants to play with her lol
[5/20/2014 6:01:22 PM] Lucifer: I figured she was talking herself up, considering she didn't hesitate to choke mercury. Or anyone else. She seemed very quietly in control, you know?
[5/20/2014 6:01:50 PM] Deano: It makes sence uvu
[5/20/2014 6:01:57 PM] Deano: I also see it as a bit of a show
[5/20/2014 6:02:07 PM] Deano: like she /had/ to do it for her reputation kind of thing
[5/20/2014 6:02:12 PM] Deano: nobody gets to lie to her face and get away with it
[5/20/2014 6:02:18 PM] Lucifer: ;~; yeah
[5/20/2014 6:02:31 PM] Lucifer: i agree.
[5/20/2014 6:03:12 PM] Deano: now I wanna watch it again
[5/20/2014 6:03:14 PM] Deano: but I know it'll only hurt LOL
[5/20/2014 6:03:26 PM] Deano: I can do her speech from memory oops
[5/20/2014 6:03:55 PM] Lucifer: Yeah, I loved her speech but it hurts. I can't watch that episode.
[5/20/2014 6:04:10 PM] Deano: It never impacted me much and then I started RP'ing it and omg
[5/20/2014 6:04:15 PM] Deano: can't even I cry everytime lol
[5/20/2014 6:04:39 PM] Lucifer: lmfao it makes it worse when you're emotionally invested in the characters.
[5/20/2014 6:05:26 PM] Lucifer: i didn't cry when i watched gabriel die the first time, but after i started really digging into the character, now i can't watch it without blubbering like a damn prison bitch.
[5/20/2014 6:05:39 PM] Deano: ^that
[5/20/2014 6:06:04 PM] Lucifer: it's horrible lmao
[5/20/2014 7:03:12 PM] Deano: Drinks wine
[5/20/2014 7:21:19 PM] Deano: So sleepy
[5/20/2014 9:19:47 PM] Deano: Clings to
[5/20/2014 9:19:52 PM] Deano: I'm having a not so good night
[5/20/2014 9:22:05 PM] Lucifer: SAME
[5/20/2014 9:22:09 PM] Lucifer: I need booze
[5/20/2014 9:29:11 PM] Deano: I'm going to drink this bottle of wine and either play AC or watch the Anna Episodes
[5/20/2014 9:30:10 PM] Lucifer: lmao I need wine. //cries about it
[5/20/2014 9:32:49 PM] Deano: *shares*
[5/20/2014 9:52:41 PM] Deano: dude
[5/20/2014 9:52:47 PM] Deano: I'm drinking wine out of a bottle with a crazy straw
[5/20/2014 9:52:51 PM] Deano: I am the epitome of class
[5/20/2014 9:53:14 PM] Lucifer: LMAO OMG
[5/20/2014 9:57:49 PM] Lucifer: i'm sick of them killing every angel who isn't castiel.
[5/20/2014 10:00:52 PM] Deano: I KNOW
[5/20/2014 10:01:01 PM] Deano: *flips a table*
[5/20/2014 10:01:30 PM] Lucifer: i truly hope they don't bring gabe back next seasons. it legitimately worries me...
[5/20/2014 10:01:44 PM] Deano: ^that
[5/20/2014 10:01:47 PM] Deano: G really wants him back
[5/20/2014 10:01:49 PM] Deano: and I'm just like
[5/20/2014 10:01:53 PM] Deano: dude they're going to shit all over him
[5/20/2014 10:02:00 PM] Deano: and it makes me super anxious
[5/20/2014 10:02:24 PM] Lucifer: the dark stuff already has me concerned for his character.
[5/20/2014 10:02:46 PM] Lucifer: on top of the fact that NO angel lives when it comes to being around Cas and the Winchesters
[5/20/2014 10:02:56 PM] Deano: yeah
[5/20/2014 10:02:59 PM] Deano: jfc
[5/20/2014 10:03:07 PM] Deano: they just fucking kill people bc ooooh such cool wow
[5/20/2014 10:03:08 PM] Deano: no fuck u
[5/20/2014 10:03:17 PM] Deano: LET THE CHARACTERS DEVELOP GODDAMNIT
[5/20/2014 10:03:40 PM] Lucifer: I know. :/
[5/20/2014 10:03:49 PM] Lucifer: fuck all if you're not part of the main three
[5/20/2014 10:04:21 PM] Lucifer: tbh him being back on the show is a death sentence. that's how i see it.
[5/20/2014 10:05:16 PM] Lucifer: they've yet to make an exception in 5 seasons, so i don't know why they would start now.
[5/20/2014 10:05:41 PM] Deano: they legit just
[5/20/2014 10:05:42 PM] Deano: bring people back
[5/20/2014 10:05:44 PM] Deano: to kill them
[5/20/2014 10:05:45 PM] Deano: tessa
[5/20/2014 10:05:50 PM] Deano: and that one chick
[5/20/2014 10:05:55 PM] Deano: I think her name was sarah
[5/20/2014 10:05:56 PM] Deano: or something
[5/20/2014 10:06:01 PM] Deano: OH AND LOOK THEY HAVE VAGNIAS
[5/20/2014 10:06:04 PM] Deano: LADIES MUST DIE
[5/20/2014 10:06:07 PM] Deano: screeches
[5/20/2014 10:06:08 PM] Lucifer: YEP
[5/20/2014 10:06:11 PM] Lucifer: EXACTLY
[5/20/2014 10:06:13 PM] Lucifer: >.>
[5/20/2014 10:06:46 PM] Lucifer: i'm happy with gabe being alive and off screen. i don't need him on the show. i really don't because that just makes me anxious.
[5/20/2014 10:11:34 PM] Deano: agree
[5/20/2014 10:11:40 PM] Deano: I liked his death tho
[5/20/2014 10:11:43 PM] Deano: LIKE
[5/20/2014 10:11:46 PM] Deano: when Bobby died
[5/20/2014 10:11:51 PM] Deano: that episode made me cry for two hours straight
[5/20/2014 10:11:53 PM] Deano: and then wowow he's a ghost
[5/20/2014 10:11:56 PM] Deano: and his death lost it's impact
[5/20/2014 10:13:21 PM] Lucifer: agreed
[5/20/2014 10:13:37 PM] Lucifer: and i feel that they'll claim some shit that gabriel faked his death-
[5/20/2014 10:14:02 PM] Deano: they sort of did
[5/20/2014 10:14:05 PM] Deano: and I think they would
[5/20/2014 10:14:07 PM] Deano: and god it upsets me
[5/20/2014 10:14:09 PM] Deano: and G fucking lvoes it
[5/20/2014 10:14:12 PM] Deano: and I hate it so much
[5/20/2014 10:14:15 PM] Deano: and she annoys me with it lol
[5/20/2014 10:14:19 PM] Lucifer: I'm rejecting it.
[5/20/2014 10:14:38 PM] Lucifer: that was the moment i decided my gabe would be canon-divergent
[5/20/2014 10:14:46 PM] Lucifer: because i don't agree with him faking his death
[5/20/2014 10:14:52 PM] Lucifer: it shits allover his development
[5/20/2014 10:14:55 PM] Deano: agree
[5/20/2014 10:14:56 PM] Deano: which is why
[5/20/2014 10:15:00 PM] Deano: G stopped playing on onelasttrick
[5/20/2014 10:15:04 PM] Deano: and made a new gabe blog and hid it from me
[5/20/2014 10:15:10 PM] Deano: because I didn't like him faking his death
[5/20/2014 10:15:15 PM] Deano: it makes me anxious
[5/20/2014 10:15:22 PM] Deano: and thinking about it now is just pissing me off
[5/20/2014 10:15:33 PM] Deano: ugh I just told her I wanted to be alone but really I just didn't want to talk to her anymore bc I'd just get annoyed
[5/20/2014 10:15:57 PM] Lucifer: plus the overall look they seem to have for him lined up, i'm not liking.
[5/20/2014 10:16:04 PM] Deano: sorry oversharing apaprntly drinking through a crazy straw doesn't slow down the wine intake
[5/20/2014 10:16:33 PM] Lucifer: gabriel died for humanity; he died for a purpose---- and.... well.... having him be "darker" whatever the fuck that means, i'm assuming antagonist, doesnt sit well with me.
[5/20/2014 10:16:42 PM] Deano: thank u
[5/20/2014 10:16:48 PM] Deano: and I'm going with it bc I love her and I miss playing with her
[5/20/2014 10:16:50 PM] Deano: but I hate it lol
[5/20/2014 10:17:02 PM] Deano: *flips a million tables*
[5/20/2014 10:18:56 PM] Lucifer: lmao I mean, I know some people are going by that. But I've invested too much time into my blog to change him and tbh, that aspect of him shouldn't be changed. Gabriel went from being terrified of standing for himself, to dying as a martyr for humanity--- to save them. That's some major shit, which is why I cannot see him in a darker light. Not in the way they seem to be eluding to.
[5/20/2014 10:19:12 PM] Lucifer: I mean he's always been a little dark, but he's not evil. He's not a villain.
[5/20/2014 10:20:39 PM] Deano: I'd rage
[5/20/2014 10:20:41 PM] Deano: if they made
[5/20/2014 10:20:42 PM] Deano: him the bad guy
[5/20/2014 10:20:43 PM] Deano: omg
[5/20/2014 10:21:19 PM] Lucifer: I will too.
[5/20/2014 10:21:29 PM] Lucifer: I'll be so fucking pissed
[5/20/2014 10:22:03 PM] Deano: i will cut a bitch
[5/20/2014 10:22:04 PM] Deano: lol
[5/20/2014 10:22:36 PM] Lucifer: I'm just ignoring his canon. lol.
[5/20/2014 10:22:49 PM] Lucifer: My Gabriel isn't fallen, nor will he ever be.
[5/20/2014 10:22:58 PM] Lucifer: and he sures the fuck didn't fake his death.
[5/20/2014 10:23:07 PM] Deano: ^that
[5/20/2014 10:23:09 PM] Deano: like
[5/20/2014 10:23:15 PM] Deano: screams into oblivion
[5/20/2014 10:23:17 PM] Deano: I'm so frusterated
[5/20/2014 10:23:18 PM] Deano: rn
[5/20/2014 10:23:18 PM] Lucifer: I knew they would elude to that. I fucking knew it.
[5/20/2014 10:23:32 PM] Lucifer: that they would insinuate that he faked his death
[5/20/2014 10:23:38 PM] Deano: an d I don' know what the fuck's so terrible about my akli that she had to make a new goddamn blog and lie to mea bout it for a fucking month
[5/20/2014 10:23:50 PM] Deano: fINALLY GET BABIES ON CANON AND SHE FUCKING LEAVES
[5/20/2014 10:23:52 PM] Deano: AND GABE WAS A DICK FOR AWHILE
[5/20/2014 10:23:56 PM] Deano: AND I'M JUST SO AGNRY
[5/20/2014 10:23:59 PM] Deano: and a little drunk
[5/20/2014 10:24:04 PM] Deano: I'm sorry nobody else lets me complain
[5/20/2014 10:24:14 PM] Lucifer: you can complain to me xD
[5/20/2014 10:24:18 PM] Deano: they all just say that G's mean or shit bc they don't know her
[5/20/2014 10:24:23 PM] Deano: but I know that she didn't do it intentionally
[5/20/2014 10:24:25 PM] Deano: but I'm still pissed about it
[5/20/2014 10:24:27 PM] Deano: sighs
[5/20/2014 10:24:36 PM] Deano: my ex and my sam winchester both hate her >.>
[5/20/2014 10:24:46 PM] Lucifer: she didn't. g isn't mean. at all.
[5/20/2014 10:24:50 PM] Lucifer: she's a sweetheart.
[5/20/2014 10:24:54 PM] Deano: I know ;-;
[5/20/2014 10:25:02 PM] Deano: I love her a lot
[5/20/2014 10:25:05 PM] Deano: but I'm still annoyed lol
[5/20/2014 10:25:14 PM] Lucifer: i mean ffs she feels guilty if she even thinks she upsets people
[5/20/2014 10:25:18 PM] Lucifer: and apologizes
[5/20/2014 10:25:25 PM] Lucifer: even if there's nothing to apologize for
[5/20/2014 10:25:29 PM] Lucifer: I know.
[5/20/2014 10:25:50 PM] Deano: yeah
[5/20/2014 10:26:51 PM] Deano: It just
[5/20/2014 10:26:54 PM] Deano: ugh
[5/20/2014 10:27:16 PM] Lucifer: but i get whatyer saying. I think maybe she probably thought you'd be upset by Meta!Gabriel. idk, i doubt it was malicious.
[5/20/2014 10:27:41 PM] Deano: I was going through a hard time, and yeah, talking about the gabe up would get me all worked up and upset so that's why she hid it
[5/20/2014 10:27:49 PM] Deano: but it also explains why she stopped playing with me on onelasttrick
[5/20/2014 10:27:54 PM] Deano: and that amps up my anxiety
[5/20/2014 10:28:03 PM] Deano: bc my ex girlfriend who was my rp partner p much did that same thing to me
[5/20/2014 10:28:08 PM] Deano: so it's like fucking war flashbacks
[5/20/2014 10:28:19 PM] Lucifer: :( well, she hasn't said anything to me. as far as i know she loved your kali and still does.
[5/20/2014 10:28:28 PM] Deano: ;a; thank you

[5/20/2014 10:48:19 PM] Lucifer: ahahaha sometimes things happen ; fighting makes me anxious. i'm a coward.
[5/20/2014 10:48:56 PM] Deano: let's not do any fighting then uvu

[5/20/2014 10:51:28 PM] Lucifer: i think i pissed her off when i made bart.

[5/21/2014 8:46:25 PM] Lucifer: ;n; thank you dlskdkld i'm glad you liked it D: i was worried about the kind of reception it would get but i feel like it's pretty on mark for angel anatomy and their povs'.
[5/21/2014 8:48:40 PM] Lucifer: i feel like his interpretation of kali is a lot like how Cas treats Dean, in that she represents something to idolize, to fill the void where God once mainstayed. Because angels, they sort of need that ?? like... they're programmed to love God above themselves, and without that faith, it sort of gets substituted elsewhere. Which is why Dean and Kali would be poignant figures in Gabriel and Cas's lives.
[5/21/2014 8:48:44 PM] Lucifer: you feel?
[5/21/2014 8:49:41 PM] Deano: yus
[5/21/2014 8:49:56 PM] Deano: I read somewhere that she realized what he was via the way he loved her
[5/21/2014 8:50:00 PM] Deano: because it was sort of like worship
[5/21/2014 8:50:06 PM] Lucifer: it is

[5/25/2014 8:34:33 PM] Lucifer: i'm afraid to try him; my cas is poor enough, although aria gave him a stamp of approval and said my voice was strong for him- so there's that.
[5/25/2014 8:35:07 PM] Lucifer: i still think he sucks, but it makes me feel slightly better that i'm not completely fucking him up
[5/25/2014 8:35:13 PM] Lucifer: i tried dean once
[5/25/2014 8:36:40 PM] Lucifer: it wasn't that bad, but not good either, though i made him when i still didn't know much of the show, so he might be better now. idk.

[6/5/2014 12:36:54 AM] Lucifer: I don't think she was a bitch. I think she was proud, maybe a little arrogant, and definitely precocious, but not a bitch.
[6/5/2014 12:36:54 AM] Deano: and I kind of ship her with this Abaddon I was talking to
[6/5/2014 12:37:01 AM] Deano: and G saw a post and unfollowed me >.>

[6/5/2014 12:42:46 AM] Lucifer: no, she's not a villain. she loved gabriel.
[6/5/2014 12:42:58 AM] Deano: she's mostly just pushing his buttons because she finds angry sex tis the best sex
[6/5/2014 12:43:03 AM] Deano: AND YES SHE LOVES HIM GODDAMNIT
[6/5/2014 12:43:51 AM] Lucifer: i would play with you but idk how G would handle that and I don't want her to freak out about it.
[6/5/2014 12:45:08 AM] Lucifer: bc i feel like sometimes she feels that i might try and take you from her. :/ she never voices it, or really says anything, but i think on some level she gets worried.
[6/5/2014 12:45:42 AM] Deano: She wouldn't like it--- yes she's told me, that she's worried I'll replace her with you
[6/5/2014 12:45:48 AM] Deano: and I've expliained tha tit odesn't work like that
[6/5/2014 12:46:00 AM] Deano: like-- I adore you
[6/5/2014 12:46:03 AM] Deano: but I'm in love with her LOL
[6/5/2014 12:46:12 AM] Deano: even tho she's straight and can never love me back the same way oops
[6/5/2014 12:46:24 AM] Lucifer: ahahaha nah i get it.
[6/5/2014 12:47:38 AM] Lucifer: i would never try that anyway.
[6/5/2014 12:48:41 AM] Deano: it's okay
[6/5/2014 12:48:46 AM] Deano: plus you have a Kali
[6/5/2014 12:48:55 AM] Deano: and I wouldn't wanna get in between that
[6/5/2014 12:49:08 AM] Lucifer: I do. xD I wouldn't do that to her either.
[6/5/2014 12:49:18 AM] Deano: lol it would be cruel
[6/5/2014 12:50:45 AM] Lucifer: it would. g just needs to stop ; because i can tell when she's getting her hackles up, i felt it when we started rping between gabe and anna, she got a bit bristely. and i'm like---- does it bother you or something? and she's like "lol no why would i care?" i'm like..... <.<
[6/5/2014 12:52:39 AM] Deano: She didn't say anything to me, but it wouldn't surprise me
[6/5/2014 12:52:50 AM] Deano: her and I are both super posseivle like to unhealthy levels
[6/5/2014 12:52:58 AM] Deano: I'm just the only one who really admits it
[6/5/2014 12:53:22 AM] Lucifer: yeah she doesn't like to share you
[6/5/2014 12:53:31 AM] Deano: Her and I came to an agreement tho that having limits on each other was only stressing each other out, so we decided to let eachother ship and play with whoever
[6/5/2014 12:53:39 AM] Deano: because for a long time I didn't play with any Gabes
[6/5/2014 12:53:46 AM] Deano: the only exception was weeklyworlnews
[6/5/2014 12:53:51 AM] Deano: because the mun and I are super close ooc
[6/5/2014 12:54:00 AM] Lucifer: yeah
[6/5/2014 12:55:06 AM] Lucifer: i understand. exclusivity can be hard and cause a lot of issues.
[6/5/2014 12:55:57 AM] Lucifer: i dealt with that before and the mun whom i was exclusive with got uber possessive and would tear me apart via skype if i even posted an ask of a same character as theirs.
[6/5/2014 12:56:08 AM] Deano: It get's rough
[6/5/2014 12:56:16 AM] Deano: I used to talk to ummm that one gabriel
[6/5/2014 12:56:22 AM] Deano: wingless protection something
[6/5/2014 12:56:28 AM] Lucifer: olive?
[6/5/2014 12:56:33 AM] Deano: I think so
[6/5/2014 12:56:35 AM] Deano: G got really upset
[6/5/2014 12:56:51 AM] Deano: and she was like if u play with them on new Kali tell me so I don't go to your blog
[6/5/2014 12:56:57 AM] Deano: and I was like, dude I'm not gonna but ok
[6/5/2014 12:57:07 AM] Lucifer: she doesn't like her much
[6/5/2014 12:57:41 AM] Lucifer: she follows me on my gabe and she's okay. she's just whiny and complains a lot. but idk. i'm not sure why G is that way over her.
[6/5/2014 12:57:48 AM] Deano: she does whine a lot
[6/5/2014 12:57:53 AM] Deano: it's annoying I wound up unfollwing
[6/5/2014 12:58:04 AM] Lucifer: it is.
[6/5/2014 12:58:04 AM] Deano: I talked to that one gabe for awhile too, secretly
[6/5/2014 12:58:16 AM] Deano: I dont' remember url but they were very good
[6/5/2014 12:58:20 AM] Deano: we've talked about them before
[6/5/2014 12:58:27 AM] Lucifer: fugitivuus?
[6/5/2014 12:58:32 AM] Deano: yepp
[6/5/2014 12:58:39 AM] Lucifer: yeah they were
[6/5/2014 12:58:45 AM] Deano: they were super young too
[6/5/2014 12:58:47 AM] Deano: like wowowow young
[6/5/2014 12:58:56 AM] Lucifer: isn't the mun like 15 or some shit
[6/5/2014 12:59:46 AM] Deano: I think spo
[6/5/2014 12:59:50 AM] Lucifer: i'll be honest, i always wondered why you wouldn't ever talk to me on mine, i thought it was because i wasn't good enough or you didn't like me. :/
[6/5/2014 1:00:05 AM] Deano: NOOO!! It was because I didn't talk to other Gabes because I didn't wana upset G
[6/5/2014 1:00:18 AM] Deano: also-- if she knew I was talking about her now she'd be pissed because we're talking behind her back ugh
[6/5/2014 1:00:36 AM] Lucifer: not really just about her insecurities, nothing bad.
[6/5/2014 1:01:10 AM] Deano: Plus I've talked mostly good things about her lol
[6/5/2014 1:01:37 AM] Lucifer: but yeah, i think i followed you with him once and ended up unfollowing bc you never followed back but i saw old interactions with other gabriels and i thought like- idk, i knew you were picky and i thought mine just wasn't good enough.
[6/5/2014 1:02:02 AM] Deano: NO!!!
[6/5/2014 1:02:14 AM] Lucifer: but i didn't know the stuff you had with g at the time
[6/5/2014 1:02:15 AM] Deano: I just played with a few in the beginging and then foun out how much it upset G
[6/5/2014 1:02:44 AM] Lucifer: ;n; she got upset because i was rping another gabriel on my lucifer.
[6/5/2014 1:02:53 AM] Deano: She's v insecure
[6/5/2014 1:02:54 AM] Lucifer: which- we kind of got into a fight over that
[6/5/2014 1:02:59 AM] Deano: I didn't know that
[6/5/2014 1:03:17 AM] Lucifer: I'm like well you rp with other cas' and other lucifers but i can't play with other gabes??
[6/5/2014 1:03:28 AM] Lucifer: bc i had a thread with nuntixs
[6/5/2014 1:03:37 AM] Deano: That's a gabe, right?
[6/5/2014 1:03:40 AM] Lucifer: yeah
[6/5/2014 1:04:55 AM] Lucifer: and i was trying to get gabe to do some stuff with me on lu and she was all getting upset over the fact that i was playing with another gabriel, saying that she didn't want to thread with me bc she felt inferior and our writing matched better (mine and nuntixs) and i'm like........
[6/5/2014 1:05:01 AM] Lucifer: you can't be serious
[6/5/2014 1:05:10 AM] Deano: on onelasttrick shit got really bad
[6/5/2014 1:05:18 AM] Deano: I think she's doing a little betterwith new blog
[6/5/2014 1:05:22 AM] Lucifer: she is
[6/5/2014 1:05:48 AM] Deano: i Think it's fucking stupid
[6/5/2014 1:05:59 AM] Lucifer: what is? her insecurity?
[6/5/2014 1:06:24 AM] Deano: yeah
[6/5/2014 1:06:30 AM] Deano: especially on onelasttrick
[6/5/2014 1:06:35 AM] Deano: it upsets me lol
[6/5/2014 1:07:36 AM] Lucifer: she's severely insecure. and tbh honest i'm surprised she even follows my gabe at all on her new one. :/ because she didn't on her last one, so that's definitely a step forward.
[6/5/2014 1:07:40 AM] Deano: her feelings toward Kali upsets me a lot
[6/5/2014 1:07:44 AM] Deano: piss me off
[6/5/2014 1:07:47 AM] Lucifer: :(
[6/5/2014 1:07:48 AM] Lucifer: yeah
[6/5/2014 1:07:49 AM] Deano: which is why we don't play it much anymore
[6/5/2014 1:08:20 AM] Lucifer: I don't know Kali's character enough to really dig into her but I don't think she's a bitch at all. :/
[6/5/2014 1:08:44 AM] Deano: me neither
[6/5/2014 1:08:48 AM] Deano: and liek I said
[6/5/2014 1:08:53 AM] Deano: Itake it personally when people call her a btich
[6/5/2014 1:08:57 AM] Deano: which cause d alot of problems
[6/5/2014 1:09:06 AM] Deano: she also think's Shikha is a bitch
[6/5/2014 1:09:09 AM] Lucifer: i'm kind of pissed over the gadreel stuff now tbh.
[6/5/2014 1:09:10 AM] Deano: which relaly pissed Kali off
[6/5/2014 1:09:14 AM] Deano: and the pissed me off
[6/5/2014 1:09:18 AM] Deano: Gadreel?
[6/5/2014 1:09:42 AM] Lucifer: yeah <.< because his entire development is based on shitting on Lucifer's character.
[6/5/2014 1:09:49 AM] Lucifer: they changed lucifer's canon
[6/5/2014 1:09:53 AM] Lucifer: to victimize gadreel
[6/5/2014 1:10:46 AM] Deano: cries
[6/5/2014 1:10:56 AM] Deano: She always talks about how hot Gadreel makes her
[6/5/2014 1:10:59 AM] Deano: and I'm like SHUT UP
[6/5/2014 1:11:17 AM] Deano: I get it, you're striaght big fucking deal
[6/5/2014 1:12:06 AM] Lucifer: originally and it was made clear, lucifer's canon backstory was that god created man and he defied god bc of it, because they were unworthy and started a war, and god had him kicked out and he retaliated by corrupting mankind and making demons- i.e. lilth.
[6/5/2014 1:12:12 AM] Lucifer: which landed him into the cage
[6/5/2014 1:12:41 AM] Lucifer: now they've completely erased that and said that he manipulated gadreel to let him into eden.
[6/5/2014 1:12:50 AM] Deano: ughh
[6/5/2014 1:13:26 AM] Lucifer: it makes me angry
[6/5/2014 1:13:56 AM] Deano: D :
[6/5/2014 1:13:58 AM] Deano: I'm sorry
[6/5/2014 1:14:05 AM] Deano: Dean won't let me like Gadreel
[6/5/2014 1:14:08 AM] Deano: he killed LKevin
[6/5/2014 1:14:20 AM] Lucifer: Yeah :/
[6/5/2014 1:14:37 AM] Deano: cries abou tkevin
[6/5/2014 1:14:41 AM] Deano: that's when i stopped caring about spn
[6/5/2014 1:14:43 AM] Deano: when Kevin died
[6/5/2014 1:16:57 AM] Lucifer: :/ yeah ; i'm just.... i don't pay much attention to it anymore. i don't care to. and i'm sorry you guys are having issues over Kali, she's a great character.
[6/5/2014 1:18:27 AM] Deano: ;-; it sucks balls
[6/5/2014 1:18:30 AM] Deano: AND I LOVE OUR CHILDREN
[6/5/2014 1:18:32 AM] Deano: even if she doesn't
[6/5/2014 1:18:37 AM] Deano: Shikha is mah bb
[6/5/2014 1:18:50 AM] Deano: and yes, she's a little shit-- but SHE'S A FUCKING SPOILED CHILD OFC SHE'S A LITTLE SHIT
[6/5/2014 1:19:03 AM] Lucifer: bahahahaha cute bbs
[6/5/2014 1:21:09 AM] Lucifer: she's never talked about kali to me, just made it clear that you're hers. she even threatened me. :/ which she said it was a joke but tbh i'm not sure if it is or not. cause i asked her if she was worried that i was honing in on you, and she was like "nah i'm not. but if you do, i'll cut you. >.>" and i was like.. threats are unnecessary. and she was like "oh i'm sorry it was a joke D:"
[6/5/2014 1:21:11 AM] Lucifer: idk
[6/5/2014 1:21:13 AM] Lucifer: :/
[6/5/2014 1:21:23 AM] Lucifer: part of me still thinks she was serious
[6/5/2014 1:21:42 AM] Deano: D :
[6/5/2014 1:21:49 AM] Deano: that's not cool at all
[6/5/2014 1:23:42 AM] Lucifer: :/ yeah idk like i would never do that, but i asked it because i felt her getting obviously bristley over our anna gabriel stuff and i asked because she suddenly interjected her gabe and your anna shipping and stuff into a conversation that wasn't even about that ?? it felt territorial to me. and i think it was after i posted a wip to her for anna to look at bc i wasn't sure about the voicing.
[6/5/2014 1:24:51 AM] Deano: D:::::
[6/5/2014 1:24:58 AM] Lucifer: she was like "my gabe and anna and anna, they just bang all the time. idk how but it always ends up there."
[6/5/2014 1:25:03 AM] Lucifer: is what she said to me
[6/5/2014 1:25:08 AM] Lucifer: and i'm like <.<
[6/5/2014 1:25:11 AM] Deano: >.>
[6/5/2014 1:25:12 AM] Deano: <.>
[6/5/2014 1:25:26 AM] Deano: it's funny bc her and I never RP smut but our characters do always end up banging
[6/5/2014 1:26:14 AM] Lucifer: tbqh it kind of annoyed me that she said that because it was verily obvious that she was staking some sort of unspoken claim on you.
[6/5/2014 1:27:12 AM] Lucifer: which i didn't address it bc that's not what i rp for, but- it did dig at me a bit
[6/5/2014 1:27:16 AM] Deano: cries and then she goes and tells me I'm "trying to control her"
[6/5/2014 1:27:16 AM] Deano: wtf
[6/5/2014 1:27:27 AM] Deano: We can always play on here in secret lol
[6/5/2014 1:27:41 AM] Lucifer: bahahahaha we can xD
[6/5/2014 1:29:19 AM] Lucifer: but to me, if stuff happens, it happens, if it don't it don't, i rp for chemistry, not ships, and i wasn't even thinking that. i like the way our thread is going as it is, with their familial stuff. i rarely, if ever, make ships with my characters.
[6/5/2014 1:29:34 AM] Deano: I'm not all about ships uvu
[6/5/2014 1:29:38 AM] Deano: I'd rather just RP and see where it goes
[6/5/2014 1:29:41 AM] Lucifer: same
[6/5/2014 1:29:52 AM] Deano: But I do think Anna and Cas are complex and I'd love to explore that uvu
[6/5/2014 1:30:07 AM] Lucifer: I do too. I think there's a lot there.
[6/5/2014 1:30:10 AM] Lucifer: With them.
[6/5/2014 1:30:35 AM] Deano: I also think she hates Alle, My Sam, because I've admitted to having feelings for her ooc
[6/5/2014 1:30:48 AM] Deano: which is fucking stupid because G ALL THE TIME tells me how straight she is
[6/5/2014 1:31:05 AM] Deano: HONESTLY I think G's just where I was in high school, so far in the clsoet she's got her head up her ass
[6/5/2014 1:31:18 AM] Lucifer: Yeah
[6/5/2014 1:31:22 AM] Deano: not that I expect a relationship or antying---but we're have have the relationship of two people dating
[6/5/2014 1:31:28 AM] Deano: whether she admits it or not
[6/5/2014 1:31:33 AM] Lucifer: her possessiveness over you feels like it reaches further than rp
[6/5/2014 1:31:53 AM] Lucifer: because she takes it on a personal level
[6/5/2014 1:32:13 AM] Deano: yeah--
[6/5/2014 1:32:29 AM] Deano: but NOOOO she only loves me on a "platonic" level and that's all it will ever be
[6/5/2014 1:32:30 AM] Deano: ok
[6/5/2014 1:32:31 AM] Deano: yeah
[6/5/2014 1:32:36 AM] Deano: I'll believe that when Hell freezes over
[6/5/2014 1:32:39 AM] Deano: or when pigs fly
[6/5/2014 1:32:45 AM] Lucifer: lmao
[6/5/2014 1:32:45 AM] Deano: huffs into obvlivion
[6/5/2014 1:33:03 AM] Lucifer: g is a beautiful girl and she has a big fucking heart.
[6/5/2014 1:33:21 AM] Lucifer: she's sweet but so insecure
[6/5/2014 1:33:25 AM] Lucifer: and-
[6/5/2014 1:33:36 AM] Deano: she's very insecure
[6/5/2014 1:33:36 AM] Lucifer: like no matter what anyone says it never helps
[6/5/2014 1:33:44 AM] Deano: which makes it really hard being friends
[6/5/2014 1:33:49 AM] Deano: because you never feel good enough
[6/5/2014 1:33:55 AM] Lucifer: right
[6/5/2014 1:34:03 AM] Lucifer: it feels like a slap in the face
[6/5/2014 1:34:06 AM] Deano: yep
[6/5/2014 1:34:14 AM] Lucifer: like okay just throw my praise out the window
[6/5/2014 1:34:19 AM] Deano: yepp
[6/5/2014 1:34:44 AM] Deano: I have to confess, you can get that way too, darling. Like-- you're writing is so good and you really do need to belive me when I say how awesome I think you are because I'm not lying to you.
[6/5/2014 1:35:01 AM] Lucifer: i do
[6/5/2014 1:35:04 AM] Lucifer: i admit it
[6/5/2014 1:35:14 AM] Lucifer: i'm trying to do better
[6/5/2014 1:35:29 AM] Deano: It's okay though, I will continue to priase you because you do deserve priase
[6/5/2014 1:35:45 AM] Lucifer: especially with my gabriel, my insecurity on there is so fucking bad. lucifer i have more confidence and bart.
[6/5/2014 1:35:53 AM] Lucifer: i feel my bartholomew is decent
[6/5/2014 1:36:00 AM] Lucifer: cas, i'm still getting a handle on
[6/5/2014 1:36:03 AM] Lucifer: but i do worry
[6/5/2014 1:36:11 AM] Deano: I should play with your bart uvu
[6/5/2014 1:36:22 AM] Deano: also DUDE, DON'T WORRY BECAUSE NO MATTER WHO YO UPLAY YOU'RE GONNA KICK ASS
[6/5/2014 1:36:23 AM] Deano: like
[6/5/2014 1:36:24 AM] Deano: seriously
[6/5/2014 1:36:36 AM] Deano: there aren't very many people I look up to in the RP world ... like 3- and you're one of them
[6/5/2014 1:36:45 AM] Lucifer: really? o.O
[6/5/2014 1:36:48 AM] Lucifer: i am?
[6/5/2014 1:37:04 AM] Deano: yES
[6/5/2014 1:37:12 AM] Deano: I seriously read your writing to pick up tips and tricks
[6/5/2014 1:37:16 AM] Deano: and I aspire to be like you
[6/5/2014 1:37:18 AM] Deano: I'm not joking
[6/5/2014 1:37:30 AM] Lucifer: wow. that's.... really an honor... and very flattering.
[6/5/2014 1:37:48 AM] Lucifer: thank you ;;; ;n; i've never had anyone say that to me before
[6/5/2014 1:38:04 AM] Deano: well now you have
[6/5/2014 1:38:08 AM] Deano: and it's true
[6/5/2014 1:38:28 AM] Lucifer: i mostly worry about voicing and dialogue. that's my biggest hump.
[6/5/2014 1:38:57 AM] Deano: Well, I like your characters so far, plus the more you play the better you get
[6/5/2014 1:39:03 AM] Deano: My first dean blog is fucking humiliarting
[6/5/2014 1:39:30 AM] Lucifer: looool i've had gabriel for 4 months, and lucifer too. and they've both come along way.
[6/5/2014 1:41:14 AM] Lucifer: i looked up to fugitivuus a lot, when i was first starting out with my gabriel, and they really helped me in the inspiration department. fugitivuus was really the only gabriel i religiously stalked, and then I found G's, later on.
[6/5/2014 1:41:35 AM] Deano: G is a good Gabriel, she was the first I really connected to after WWN
[6/5/2014 1:41:48 AM] Deano: and after my Cas and I broke up she was the first person I connected to lol
[6/5/2014 1:41:54 AM] Deano: which is why I think I have such a strong pull to her
[6/5/2014 1:42:25 AM] Lucifer: yeah ; those two are/were the only two gabriels i really read and followed. because they were the only two that captured him correctly.
[6/5/2014 1:42:32 AM] Lucifer: they still are.
[6/5/2014 1:42:44 AM] Lucifer: she is. g's a fucking sweet heart
[6/5/2014 1:43:01 AM] Lucifer: i'm exceedingly, exceedingly particular with characterization.
[6/5/2014 1:43:04 AM] Lucifer: like
[6/5/2014 1:43:04 AM] Deano: She's a pain in my ass but I love her with my whole heart
[6/5/2014 1:43:22 AM] Lucifer: i've told her time and time again if she was a shitty gabriel, i wouldn't have followed her.
[6/5/2014 1:43:27 AM] Lucifer: as bad as that sounds.
[6/5/2014 1:43:45 AM] Lucifer: i have a really bad tick about that
[6/5/2014 1:43:57 AM] Deano: I've told her that too LOL
[6/5/2014 1:44:04 AM] Deano: because I'm picky as fuck
[6/5/2014 1:44:08 AM] Lucifer: i have other gabriels that follow me, but i only follow two. that's it.
[6/5/2014 1:45:22 AM] Deano: I just follow you and G lol

[6/5/2014 1:45:46 AM] Deano: yeah
[6/5/2014 1:45:58 AM] Lucifer: damn you are picky XD
[6/5/2014 1:46:26 AM] Lucifer: gabriel's voice is difficult to properly capture. not many people can correctly.
[6/5/2014 1:46:53 AM] Deano: getting on skype mobile because laptop being a little shit
[6/5/2014 1:46:58 AM] Lucifer: i know of at least three decent, to good writers, who write him well in post depth but they can't capture his voice for shit.
[6/5/2014 1:47:01 AM] Lucifer: okay
[6/5/2014 1:47:27 AM] Lucifer: there's always something off in the tone of his dialogue.
[6/5/2014 1:47:29 AM] Lucifer: or it's flat
[6/5/2014 1:49:39 AM] Lucifer: and yeah people write characters how they want, but voicing is everything and if you can't get the voice then that alone butchers the character.
[6/5/2014 1:49:53 AM] Deano: I don't think I can get Anna's voice
[6/5/2014 1:50:00 AM] Lucifer: I think you do
[6/5/2014 1:50:01 AM] Deano: She keeps twisting into dean and it frustrates me
[6/5/2014 1:50:03 AM] Lucifer: I hear her
[6/5/2014 1:50:08 AM] Lucifer: I like her
[6/5/2014 1:50:38 AM] Deano: Thank ;(
[6/5/2014 1:51:08 AM] Deano: I didn't think I'd get any followers bc nobody really likes Anna lol
[6/5/2014 1:51:26 AM] Lucifer: i get worried about gabriel's, too. :/ i worry if he's too much of a dick. :/

[6/5/2014 1:54:57 AM] Lucifer: yeah maybe idk. i'm really insecure about that blog. -laughs-
[6/5/2014 1:55:00 AM] Deano: Because G complains about it all the time and I'm just like wtf do you want me to do???? Once again it make me feel not good enough
[6/5/2014 1:55:16 AM] Deano: Like obviously I'm not good enough for you so okay avoid me and make a new blog

[6/5/2014 2:02:53 AM] Lucifer: i called it hate. bc to me anything negative is fucking hate. and g downplayed it. :/ that irked me. she was like "yeah it's rude but not really hate. they didn't tell you to kill yourself."
[6/5/2014 2:02:57 AM] Lucifer: i'm like-
[6/5/2014 2:03:25 AM] Lucifer: i'm sorry but anything spewed in a negative manner that has zero positive construct behind it is fucking hate.
[6/5/2014 2:03:32 AM] Deano: What did they say?
[6/5/2014 2:03:53 AM] Lucifer: i'll pull it up
[6/5/2014 2:04:22 AM] Deano: D : constructive criticism is complex and can only be done carefully
[6/5/2014 2:04:25 AM] Lucifer: Anonymous inquired:

the reason I do not rp with you is you seem to hardly ever reply, or you are ooc bitching about drafts/your short threads dying out/or you are hopping between all your accounts
[6/5/2014 2:05:00 AM] Lucifer: and it vehemently pissed me off
[6/5/2014 2:05:15 AM] Deano: Okay that's hate
[6/5/2014 2:05:28 AM] Lucifer: right? >.>
[6/5/2014 2:05:32 AM] Deano: Yeha

[6/5/2014 2:07:55 AM] Lucifer: what did they say?
[6/5/2014 2:08:12 AM] Lucifer: i've never been popular enough to get hate
[6/5/2014 2:08:28 AM] Deano: Me neither xD
[6/5/2014 2:08:49 AM] Deano: It was when G and I were fighting really bad and I posted how I was gonna get drunk
[6/5/2014 2:09:32 AM] Lucifer: ;n;
[6/5/2014 2:09:45 AM] Lucifer: hate is disgusting
[6/5/2014 2:10:33 AM] Lucifer: i would never condone hate

[6/5/2014 2:15:45 AM] Lucifer: do you remember what they said?
[6/5/2014 2:15:51 AM] Deano: But I'm pretty sure they were G but I'd never ask because it'd puss her off if it want
[6/5/2014 2:15:52 AM] Deano: Wasn't
[6/5/2014 2:16:11 AM] Deano: One said something about me being upset was nonreason to kill my liver
[6/5/2014 2:16:21 AM] Deano: And I replies with my liver doesn't mind, I asked him
[6/5/2014 2:16:26 AM] Deano: Bc I was being a shit lol
[6/5/2014 2:16:36 AM] Lucifer: it was probably g
[6/5/2014 2:16:46 AM] Deano: And the second talked about how much I was angry at the workd
[6/5/2014 2:16:51 AM] Deano: World
[6/5/2014 2:17:07 AM] Deano: We hadn't talked in 2/3 days at this point bc I. A huge fight we bad
[6/5/2014 2:17:11 AM] Deano: Had an
[6/5/2014 2:17:15 AM] Lucifer: :(
[6/5/2014 2:17:27 AM] Deano: And after those anons she messages me bc she was worried and I cried a lot lol
[6/5/2014 2:17:38 AM] Lucifer: still she shouldn't have sent you those anons. :/
[6/5/2014 2:18:16 AM] Lucifer: if she did
[6/5/2014 2:18:17 AM] Deano: I don't know if it was her
[6/5/2014 2:18:27 AM] Deano: I will never know
[6/5/2014 2:18:39 AM] Lucifer: i wouldn't ask
[6/5/2014 2:18:44 AM] Deano: It was that night she told me about her Gabe blog
[6/5/2014 2:18:46 AM] Lucifer: cause it would probably piss her off
[6/5/2014 2:18:52 AM] Lucifer: :(
[6/5/2014 2:18:53 AM] Deano: No I'll never ask I don't wanna know
[6/5/2014 2:19:03 AM] Deano: SMS yeah she'll get really pissed
[6/5/2014 2:19:10 AM] Deano: Especially if it's not her
[6/5/2014 2:19:20 AM] Lucifer: yeah plus it's better not knowing
[6/5/2014 2:19:32 AM] Lucifer: bc if it is that breeds trouble
[6/5/2014 2:19:42 AM] Lucifer: she shouldn't have hid that blog from you
[6/5/2014 2:20:18 AM] Deano: I know she did bc I was having a hard time with school and wouldn't ever wanna talk about meta Gabe lok
[6/5/2014 2:20:22 AM] Deano: So I forgave her
[6/5/2014 2:21:08 AM] Deano: And then-// like two days ago she randomly brought up this chatzy she'd been in for 2 weeks and this Sam she was shipping with bc she wanted to tell me a story and I fucking snapped
[6/5/2014 2:21:27 AM] Lucifer: Meta!Gabe is.... idk, as someone who also writes for him and who has done extensive character study, I really don't like the direction they're taking his character, it feels ooc for me.
[6/5/2014 2:21:34 AM] Lucifer: and i'm refusing to acknowledge it.
[6/5/2014 2:21:49 AM] Deano: I fucking hate it LOL
[6/5/2014 2:21:50 AM] Lucifer: because i already don't approve of the fact that they're making him fallen.
[6/5/2014 2:21:53 AM] Deano: I think he died.
[6/5/2014 2:22:04 AM] Deano: And if they're fucking with that fuck them
[6/5/2014 2:22:06 AM] Lucifer: that infuriates me.
[6/5/2014 2:22:18 AM] Deano: G even said she thinks he went in there knowing he was gonna die
[6/5/2014 2:22:21 AM] Lucifer: because we all know what happens to an archangel when it's fallen.
[6/5/2014 2:22:29 AM] Deano: So I hate that this is all she'll play
[6/5/2014 2:22:30 AM] Lucifer: archangels are not the same as regular angels
[6/5/2014 2:22:37 AM] Deano: I WANT MY FUCKING GABE BACK
[6/5/2014 2:22:39 AM] Lucifer: they're wired different.
[6/5/2014 2:22:40 AM] Deano: Jfc
[6/5/2014 2:23:04 AM] Lucifer: archangels are weapons. and a fallen archangel, it changes them, it turns them cold.
[6/5/2014 2:23:17 AM] Deano: Yeah ;-;
[6/5/2014 2:23:33 AM] Deano: I just hate it so much
[6/5/2014 2:23:44 AM] Deano: But she loves it so I can't say shit
[6/5/2014 2:23:53 AM] Deano: Or she'll get pissed and it'll be on me
[6/5/2014 2:24:00 AM] Lucifer: like appreciate that she's sticking to his morals, but i'm having a difficult time of accepting it.
[6/5/2014 2:24:03 AM] Deano: uGH I just miss Kali Gabe so much
[6/5/2014 2:24:09 AM] Deano: So fucking much
[6/5/2014 2:24:30 AM] Lucifer: ;n; i know. my gabe has his own set backstory and shit, and i'm not changing that.
[6/5/2014 2:24:36 AM] Lucifer: mine isn't fallen
[6/5/2014 2:24:40 AM] Deano: And I can't ask you or WWN because you both have Kali's
[6/5/2014 2:24:55 AM] Deano: And I can't complained because she liked this blog so much better
[6/5/2014 2:25:49 AM] Deano: (( also if I stop replying I didn't mean to but I passed out and ilu ))
[6/5/2014 2:25:50 AM] Lucifer: ;n; you can't play with witness and fugitivuus and nuntixs are p much inactive, so there goes those options.
[6/5/2014 2:25:57 AM] Lucifer: it's okay xD
[6/5/2014 2:26:04 AM] Lucifer: ilu2
[6/5/2014 2:26:14 AM] Deano: I don't wanna play with witness lol
[6/5/2014 2:26:18 AM] Deano: They whine too much oops
[6/5/2014 2:26:58 AM] Lucifer: i don't think my kali would care ; but i don't know, she might, and i don't want there to be issues, because i haven't seen her actively seeking other gabriels to write with.
[6/5/2014 2:27:18 AM] Lucifer: and i know other gabriels folher.
[6/5/2014 2:27:21 AM] Lucifer: follow*
[6/5/2014 2:27:33 AM] Deano: Yeah- no it's okay. G would have an aneurism lol
[6/5/2014 2:27:53 AM] Lucifer: she would. i feel like g feels threatened by me. tbqh.
[6/5/2014 2:28:00 AM] Deano: She does lol
[6/5/2014 2:28:09 AM] Lucifer: she shouldn't tho. but i get that feeling.
[6/5/2014 2:28:10 AM] Deano: Even tho I told her not to be
[6/5/2014 2:28:28 AM] Lucifer: like she's never told me and i've asked her and she's denied it.
[6/5/2014 2:28:34 AM] Deano: Like it said I have gay feels for her and ilu but not like that xD
[6/5/2014 2:29:01 AM] Lucifer: lmao as far as i know, i'm not gay, i'm asexual, so that's perfectly okay.
[6/5/2014 2:29:21 AM] Deano: I also have some gay feels for my Sam which is why I think they hate each other
[6/5/2014 2:29:57 AM] Deano: G might be asexual too, she's talked about it a little. But she's so set on being straight it feels like she's forcing it and it's frustrated.
[6/5/2014 2:30:12 AM] Deano: I think-- I'm not sure what I am. I'm homoromantic
[6/5/2014 2:30:16 AM] Deano: And a little bit asexual
[6/5/2014 2:30:26 AM] Lucifer: lmfao yeah, she might be in the closet.
[6/5/2014 2:30:27 AM] Deano: I'm some weird alien thing
[6/5/2014 2:31:15 AM] Lucifer: sex and romance to me are alien. like- i literally don't think about it. i apparently drew something that resembled a "female sex organ" and my teacher was laughing about it and i was like...... but it's not...?
[6/5/2014 2:31:30 AM] Deano: If you don't mind me asking this--/ I'm just honestly curious and of course you don't have to answer. But as asexual do you masturbate?
[6/5/2014 2:31:45 AM] Lucifer: No, I don't.
[6/5/2014 2:32:35 AM] Deano: Okay, thank you. So I'm probably not asexual. It's just-- I've thought about it because I'm something not the majority because I do masturbate but I'm not really interested in ded
[6/5/2014 2:32:36 AM] Lucifer: I don't think about sexual stuff. I don't know why, I'm just not chemically inclined to it. o.O
[6/5/2014 2:32:40 AM] Deano: Sex
[6/5/2014 2:32:54 AM] Deano: I respect that uvu
[6/5/2014 2:33:00 AM] Deano: Sex isn't that great anyway
[6/5/2014 2:33:14 AM] Lucifer: loooool cas is my power animal i swear xD
[6/5/2014 2:33:21 AM] Deano: XD
[6/5/2014 2:33:42 AM] Deano: I'd rather snuggle than anything
[6/5/2014 2:34:21 AM] Lucifer: same
[6/5/2014 2:34:24 AM] Deano: And i thought about it and I could totally do a sexless relationship as long as there were cuddles and occasionally short kisses
[6/5/2014 2:34:27 AM] Lucifer: snuggles are nice
[6/5/2014 2:34:33 AM] Deano: And hand holding
[6/5/2014 2:34:41 AM] Lucifer: yessss
[6/5/2014 2:34:46 AM] Deano: I'd like it
[6/5/2014 2:34:55 AM] Deano: Sex is too much pressure
[6/5/2014 2:35:03 AM] Lucifer: a relationship doesn't need to involve sex
[6/5/2014 2:35:06 AM] Deano: Plus I can't orgasm so it's not that fun for me
[6/5/2014 2:35:11 AM] Deano: Agree
[6/5/2014 2:35:30 AM] Lucifer: and i think that's why i have difficulty writing smut and stuff because it makes me uncomfortable to write.
[6/5/2014 2:35:52 AM] Deano: I'm just bad at smut so I don't write it lol
[6/5/2014 2:36:01 AM] Deano: It makes ah uncomfortable too
[6/5/2014 2:36:05 AM] Deano: *G
[6/5/2014 2:36:22 AM] Lucifer: lmao yeah ; it does
[6/5/2014 2:36:42 AM] Deano: Lesbians make her uncomfortable
[6/5/2014 2:36:55 AM] Lucifer: i will write it, if the scene calls for it, but it's hard for me.
[6/5/2014 2:36:58 AM] Lucifer: srsly? xD
[6/5/2014 2:37:02 AM] Lucifer: omg
[6/5/2014 2:37:03 AM] Deano: Which makes me laugh because Boobs and gay women made me super uncomfortable when I was in the closet
[6/5/2014 2:37:21 AM] Lucifer: she's probably gay and doesn't realize it
[6/5/2014 2:37:23 AM] Deano: I was so far in the closet in hs I didn't know I was in it
[6/5/2014 2:37:36 AM] Deano: I know and it's fuckjng frusterating LOL
[6/5/2014 2:37:45 AM] Deano: We've joked about living together in LA and
[6/5/2014 2:37:55 AM] Deano: It just----- it hurts because i want it so bad
[6/5/2014 2:38:13 AM] Lucifer: I plan on moving to LA, at some point, after school.
[6/5/2014 2:38:21 AM] Deano: And it stupid because she's so far away and in reality I'll probably never meet her because our relationship will die long before tbat
[6/5/2014 2:38:24 AM] Lucifer: bc that's where all the animation studios are
[6/5/2014 2:38:25 AM] Deano: ME TOO
[6/5/2014 2:38:39 AM] Deano: I want to write scripts for film uvu
[6/5/2014 2:38:48 AM] Lucifer: script writer? xD
[6/5/2014 2:38:51 AM] Deano: Mhm
[6/5/2014 2:38:58 AM] Lucifer: yeah i'm going into doing concept art
[6/5/2014 2:39:00 AM] Lucifer: for film

[6/5/2014 2:39:43 AM] Lucifer: maybe. that would be pretty awesome tbh
[6/5/2014 2:41:19 AM] Deano: It would lol
[6/5/2014 2:41:49 AM] Deano: Highly unlikely but yolo

[6/5/2014 2:44:48 AM] Deano: I can be a massive cuntwaffle sometimes but you knew that
[6/5/2014 2:44:51 AM] Lucifer: bahahaha i'm selectively a dick. not right off the bat, people usually have to provoke it.
[6/5/2014 2:45:08 AM] Deano: I'm just jealous easy and insecure LOL
[6/5/2014 2:45:23 AM] Deano: And my anxiety gets bad and I lash out I'm working on being better
[6/5/2014 2:45:36 AM] Lucifer: lmao i think a lot of people have jealousy issues especially when it comes to rp
[6/5/2014 2:45:49 AM] Lucifer: i'm that way. a lot.
[6/5/2014 2:45:57 AM] Deano: It's easy to feel like shit especiallywith rp
[6/5/2014 2:46:16 AM] Deano: I have abondonment issues too with RP so that doesn't help things
[6/5/2014 2:46:18 AM] Lucifer: when people *i* rp with, rp with others of my characters i start inwardly panicking.
[6/5/2014 2:46:26 AM] Lucifer: especially if they're better than me
[6/5/2014 2:46:36 AM] Deano: I have so many deans blacklisted lol
[6/5/2014 2:46:37 AM] Lucifer: SAME
[6/5/2014 2:46:47 AM] Lucifer: not deans
[6/5/2014 2:46:52 AM] Deano: I know HAHA
[6/5/2014 2:46:53 AM] Lucifer: but i have abandonment issues
[6/5/2014 2:47:01 AM] Deano: Yeppp it sucks
[6/5/2014 2:47:06 AM] Lucifer: i have most gabes blacklisted
[6/5/2014 2:47:15 AM] Lucifer: and i'm starting to do that with lucifers
[6/5/2014 2:47:17 AM] Lucifer: now too
[6/5/2014 2:47:23 AM] Deano: Mine was bc of a Sam and now I get like physically I'll when I see Sam/Cas or Sam/Gabe stuff
[6/5/2014 2:47:27 AM] Lucifer: because people keep dropping me for other ones.
[6/5/2014 2:47:34 AM] Lucifer: :(
[6/5/2014 2:47:43 AM] Deano: So when g brought up that Sam Gabe ship she was doing that really pushed my freak put
[6/5/2014 2:47:47 AM] Deano: And I know it's me not her
[6/5/2014 2:48:00 AM] Deano: But part of me felt like she did it on purpose to hurt me
[6/5/2014 2:48:06 AM] Lucifer: i don't see, personally, gabe and sam as a ship.
[6/5/2014 2:48:14 AM] Deano: Because I totally brought up kali abaddon once to hurt her oops
[6/5/2014 2:48:35 AM] Deano: I fucking hate it LOL it's like people were like if dean gets an angel so does Sam
[6/5/2014 2:49:20 AM] Lucifer: i don't think angels have sexes, tbw. but they adopt whatever sex their vessel is, but i don't perceive them as particularly sexual unless they've been attached to said vessel for an extensive period of time.
[6/5/2014 2:49:54 AM] Deano: At least I know my Sam won't ship it with g because they hate eachnorhe rlol
[6/5/2014 2:50:08 AM] Lucifer: gabriel's been attached to his vessel for thousands of years, so. that i can see-
[6/5/2014 2:50:17 AM] Lucifer: but i don't see him forming them for sam.
[6/5/2014 2:50:27 AM] Deano: Gabe is super sexual in my opinion bc yeah he's been not an angel for so long
[6/5/2014 2:50:28 AM] Lucifer: i saw his and sam's stuff as.... he pitied sam.
[6/5/2014 2:50:42 AM] Deano: I see more Debriel than Sam Gabe
[6/5/2014 2:50:48 AM] Lucifer: yeah
[6/5/2014 2:51:19 AM] Deano: Debriel was an accidental ship with WWN and then one day I was like holy shot it's gr9
[6/5/2014 2:51:20 AM] Deano: Yolo swag
[6/5/2014 2:51:32 AM] Lucifer: i think it works fine if played out correctly
[6/5/2014 2:52:18 AM] Deano: I think any ship can work if you play it out right there's just some that work better
[6/5/2014 2:52:31 AM] Deano: But also I'm so sleepy gonna fall asleep with phone on face
[6/5/2014 2:52:33 AM] Lucifer: it's like lucifers that curse. that gets under myy skin so fucking much

[6/10/2014 3:55:53 PM] Lucifer: sometimes i forget bart exists bc my thread count on him is so low. XD
[6/10/2014 4:56:27 PM] Deano: Sorry things keep happening irl
[6/10/2014 4:56:30 PM] Deano: I'm drinking wine now lots
[6/10/2014 4:56:46 PM] Lucifer: ;n;
[6/10/2014 4:57:26 PM] Deano: I should stop talking to G when I'm drinking fff
[6/10/2014 4:57:39 PM] Lucifer: bahaha what happened?
[6/10/2014 4:57:48 PM] Deano: Stupid things like always lol
[6/10/2014 4:57:57 PM] Deano: We're talking about my Sam who she doesn't like
[6/10/2014 4:58:05 PM] Lucifer: are you guys fighting again?
[6/10/2014 4:58:19 PM] Deano: Aren't we always? *distant laughter as I drown myself*
[6/10/2014 4:58:28 PM] Lucifer: ;n;
[6/10/2014 4:58:50 PM] Lucifer: when i feel a fight coming on i go silent
[6/10/2014 4:58:55 PM] Lucifer: and do other things
[6/10/2014 4:59:11 PM] Lucifer: because arguing is exhausting and i can't be arsed with that shit
[6/10/2014 4:59:26 PM] Deano: I love it *_*
[6/10/2014 4:59:28 PM] Deano: It's very bad
[6/10/2014 4:59:43 PM] Deano: Semi-Automatic by twenty one pilots is me sometimes
[6/10/2014 4:59:44 PM] Lucifer: love what? aruging?
[6/10/2014 4:59:49 PM] Lucifer: arguing*
[6/10/2014 4:59:51 PM] Deano: Yeah I'm bad
[6/10/2014 4:59:56 PM] Lucifer: looool
[6/10/2014 5:00:50 PM] Lucifer: the thing is that fights make me turned off to people and if i get into too many with someone, i generally distance myself and eventually cut them off.
[6/10/2014 5:01:10 PM] Lucifer: so going silent for me saves friendships <.<
[6/10/2014 5:01:40 PM] Deano: I avoided you for a long time after I was a cunt lol
[6/10/2014 5:02:00 PM] Lucifer: lmao why? i wasn't even mad
[6/10/2014 5:02:00 PM] Deano: I can just be a class A bitch sometimes and it's not intentional it's like something in me
[6/10/2014 5:02:06 PM] Deano: I FELT SO GUIKTY
[6/10/2014 5:02:16 PM] Deano: If I were you I would have slit my throat lol
[6/10/2014 5:02:17 PM] Lucifer: you could've talked to me
[6/10/2014 5:02:32 PM] Lucifer: i'm not like that tho ; i'm pretty skype
[6/10/2014 5:02:35 PM] Lucifer: omg
[6/10/2014 5:02:37 PM] Lucifer: chill
[6/10/2014 5:02:48 PM] Lucifer: fucking distractions
[6/10/2014 5:02:55 PM] Deano: Now I know haha
[6/10/2014 5:03:01 PM] Deano: I was in a bad place then
[6/10/2014 5:03:08 PM] Lucifer: ;n;
[6/10/2014 5:03:41 PM] Lucifer: brb we're taking off
[6/10/2014 5:03:46 PM] Lucifer: i'm gonna lose you;;
[6/10/2014 5:04:01 PM] Deano: Okay! Love you
[6/10/2014 5:44:32 PM] Lucifer: ily2
[6/10/2014 6:07:27 PM] Lucifer: i hope thing get better
[6/10/2014 7:52:20 PM] Deano: Watching moulin rouge
[6/10/2014 9:40:52 PM] Deano: You okay, bb?
[6/11/2014 9:06:27 AM] Lucifer: i'm fine. just tired and dealing with moods.
[6/11/2014 4:11:06 PM] Lucifer: everything's been pissing me off today. i'm sorry. it's not you.
[6/11/2014 4:18:03 PM] Lucifer: and i'm assuming my fanmail didn't go through. s2g tumblr is a piece of shit.
[6/11/2014 4:37:48 PM] Deano: Sorry, I had to go afk
[6/11/2014 4:37:51 PM] Deano: I just got the mail
[6/11/2014 4:38:42 PM] Deano: We can play with dean cas! My thing is I'm very lazy/busy/ and anxious about new people so I usually just stick to people I'm comfortable with unless someone aproaches me first
[6/11/2014 4:39:00 PM] Lucifer: well i'm not exactly new. <.<
[6/11/2014 4:40:14 PM] Lucifer: we've played together before.
[6/11/2014 4:40:22 PM] Lucifer: it's not like i'm going to vanish
[6/11/2014 4:42:02 PM] Deano: I know, that was my point lol
[6/11/2014 4:42:10 PM] Deano: we're friends so you're more than welcome to jump on any open
[6/11/2014 4:43:02 PM] Lucifer: sorry. it kinda came off like i was part of the new people. lol <.<
[6/11/2014 4:43:19 PM] Deano: No, I didn't mean it to.
[6/11/2014 4:44:14 PM] Lucifer: its fine
[6/11/2014 4:45:52 PM] Deano: getting on mobile
[6/11/2014 4:47:04 PM] Lucifer: i've wanted to for awhile now. i've just been kind of... idk, i feel like i'm impeding. :/
[6/11/2014 4:52:42 PM] Deano: You're not
[6/11/2014 4:52:51 PM] Deano: You're more than welcome to RP with me anywhere
[6/11/2014 4:54:44 PM] Lucifer: yeah i know. it's just habit, when i see people only rping with one of a character, i kinda assume it's exclusive and back off. it's not you, it's just something i do, because i'm a fearful chicken shit. and i don't want to get rained with hate for stepping on toes. <.<
[6/11/2014 5:02:17 PM] Lucifer: i've been attacked over stuff like that before so i guess i'm gun shy.
[6/11/2014 5:02:44 PM] Deano: It's okay I understand
[6/11/2014 5:02:54 PM] Deano: But seriously no worries hop on anything of mine anytime
[6/11/2014 5:05:02 PM] Lucifer: I will. Would be great to have some interaction with a Dean since the other one I play with is really slow.
[6/11/2014 5:06:10 PM] Lucifer: the only other one i've approached to rp with is pulledfromhell and the mun doesn't seem to want anything to do with me for some reason. idk why. but they just kind of always blow me off/and or ignore me.
[6/11/2014 5:10:38 PM] Deano: Hmm I think I've played with them on dean a little
[6/11/2014 5:10:44 PM] Deano: They're very slow
[6/11/2014 5:10:59 PM] Deano: Also I'm going to be very slow too because gone without internet for most of the summer 😩
[6/11/2014 5:13:24 PM] Lucifer: yeah, i just got the impression that they didn't like me for whatever reason. i've approached them on skype and they're very disengaged when talking to me ?? even though they follow some of my accounts and they added me to skype awhile bc they seemed like they wanted to plot on gabriel. then they just suddenly started acting like i was a bother and i'm not sure why.
[6/11/2014 5:13:33 PM] Lucifer: where are you going? o.O
[6/11/2014 5:16:28 PM] Deano: I've tried to talk to them a few times and got the same kind of feeling
[6/11/2014 5:16:33 PM] Deano: I have to work
[6/11/2014 5:16:35 PM] Deano: ;-;
[6/11/2014 5:17:01 PM] Lucifer: ;n;
[6/11/2014 5:17:04 PM] Lucifer: that sucks
[6/11/2014 5:17:08 PM] Deano: It really foes
[6/11/2014 5:17:16 PM] Lucifer: no time off at all?
[6/11/2014 5:17:26 PM] Deano: The Fourth of July spot I usually have wifi but I'm too tired to really do anything
[6/11/2014 5:17:45 PM] Deano: A few weekends here and there but we'll be cleaning stuff so it doesn't really end lol
[6/11/2014 5:17:48 PM] Lucifer: where do you work?
[6/11/2014 5:18:16 PM] Deano: For my parents we travel to fairs and work them with our wagon
[6/11/2014 5:18:20 PM] Deano: It's hard to explain
[6/11/2014 5:18:27 PM] Deano: It's also a lot of hard work
[6/11/2014 5:18:40 PM] Lucifer: ooooooo
[6/11/2014 5:18:51 PM] Lucifer: that's kind of neat.
[6/11/2014 5:18:55 PM] Lucifer: so you guys go allover
[6/11/2014 5:19:08 PM] Deano: All I've Michigan yep!
[6/11/2014 5:19:16 PM] Deano: It gave me lots of life experience lol
[6/11/2014 5:19:33 PM] Lucifer: that's neat (cat)
[6/11/2014 6:47:51 PM] Lucifer: i feel like crying
[6/11/2014 6:48:40 PM] Lucifer: i feel like nobody cares. nobody wants me around.
[6/11/2014 6:49:22 PM] Deano: D :
[6/11/2014 6:49:25 PM] Deano: That's not true bb
[6/11/2014 6:50:37 PM] Lucifer: i want to do short things on cas but that's kind of hard when nobody wants to do shit with me. like----- idk, i feel like nobody which blog i'm on nobody gives a flying fuck. i always fucking get ignored.
[6/11/2014 6:51:22 PM] Lucifer: sometimes i wonder what the fucking point is
[6/11/2014 6:59:37 PM] Deano: I don't know what you want me to say that I haven't already said?
[6/11/2014 7:00:20 PM] Lucifer: you don't have to say anything. it doesn't matter.
[6/11/2014 7:13:12 PM] Lucifer: i don't matter. and if i deleted i doubt anybody would even care.
[6/11/2014 7:15:58 PM] Deano: You know that's not true.
[6/11/2014 7:17:27 PM] Lucifer: I'm crying. I'm having a panic attack. I've never been so close to deletion.
[6/11/2014 7:39:06 PM] Lucifer: are you pissed at me?
[6/11/2014 7:40:19 PM] Deano: I'm not pissed at you, but you know that you'd be missed. Tumblr isn't supposed to be a source of stress though, and if it is that bad maybe deletion would be good for you. At least until you're heads in the right place then re create.
[6/11/2014 7:41:13 PM] Lucifer: i can't delete
[6/11/2014 7:42:08 PM] Lucifer: as much as i feel like doing it, because there are like two people who do give a shit, and they're the reason i stay.
[6/11/2014 7:42:50 PM] Deano: Maybe hiatus? If it's that bad some space might be good
[6/11/2014 7:43:10 PM] Lucifer: why do you want me to leave? <.<
[6/11/2014 7:43:29 PM] Deano: What else am I supposed to say, dude?
[6/11/2014 7:44:24 PM] Deano: You had a panick attack over tumblr. It's clearly not good for your mental health. You want me to beg you to stay? I've done that plenty of times and the same problem is occurring. I just want you to be okay. Your health is more important than RP.
[6/11/2014 7:44:42 PM] Lucifer: ;n;
[6/11/2014 7:45:04 PM] Deano: I'm sorry- I'm not trying to come off as a bitch. I'm really not. But I do care about you.
[6/11/2014 7:45:48 PM] Lucifer: No, it's fine. I'm just... idk, I have a lot of emotional issues. It's not tumblr. It's me.
[6/11/2014 7:49:15 PM] Lucifer: It's my own insecurities and feeling like shit all the time.
[6/11/2014 7:56:16 PM] Lucifer: there's something wrong with me ;
[6/11/2014 8:00:16 PM] Deano: I'm sorry ;-;
[6/11/2014 8:01:12 PM] Lucifer: it is what it is. nothing is ever going to change no matter what i do. i'm always going to be a failure.
[6/11/2014 8:02:00 PM] Deano: You're not a failure :/
[6/11/2014 8:02:52 PM] Lucifer: I am, tho. Every aspect of my life is a joke. I'm a joke.
[6/11/2014 8:10:53 PM] Lucifer: i'm sorry if i'm bothering you
[6/11/2014 8:12:30 PM] Deano: I just don't know what more I can say
[6/11/2014 8:13:35 PM] Lucifer: Just be there for me. As a friend. :/
[6/11/2014 8:14:39 PM] Deano: Okay, bb (heart)
[6/11/2014 8:15:12 PM] Lucifer: I'm trying to vent to, to get this stuff out and I feel like I'm an annoyance.
[6/11/2014 8:16:53 PM] Lucifer: like if you want me to leave you alone that's fine, i will.
[6/11/2014 8:17:31 PM] Deano: It just gets frusterating for me- because I feel like no matter what I say it's not helping?
[6/11/2014 8:18:14 PM] Lucifer: well i'm sorry i'm frustrating you
[6/11/2014 8:32:28 PM] Lucifer: i'm going to bed.
[8/7/2014 8:06:55 PM] Deano: Hey there~
[8/7/2014 8:07:25 PM] Lucifer: haiiii (cat)
[8/7/2014 8:09:06 PM] Lucifer: what's up?
[8/7/2014 8:10:22 PM] Deano: G's all upset and I think it's bc of witness ugh
[8/7/2014 8:10:27 PM] Deano: Clings
[8/7/2014 8:10:29 PM] Deano: I'm at work
[8/7/2014 8:10:31 PM] Deano: How're you?
[8/7/2014 8:11:30 PM] Lucifer: Yeah, I think so too. :( I don't know what to say to her tho bc nothing I say seems to help or cheer her up.
[8/7/2014 8:11:52 PM] Lucifer: I'm okay. I'm bouncing between blogs atm. ;v; How is work going?
[8/7/2014 8:14:10 PM] Lucifer: tbh i dont even think she ever believes when i try to reassure her but i wish she would.
[8/7/2014 8:15:40 PM] Deano: It's the same way with me too. And she just recently admitted how much I hurt her when I played with them when we FIRST had our blogs. And it's like. One thread with three posts that I dropped
[8/7/2014 8:15:45 PM] Deano: And it's all my faukt
[8/7/2014 8:15:47 PM] Deano: Fault
[8/7/2014 8:15:48 PM] Deano: Sighs
[8/7/2014 8:20:27 PM] Lucifer: :( Yeah, I think sometimes I've perpetuated her insecurity bc sometimes I'll throw her WIPS, but I'm not trying to hurt her?? I just--- it's nice to have feedback from her bc I admire her Gabriel. But she shouldn't hold that against you. It was one thread. Three tosses that you dropped, so clearly it meant nothing. Why does she hate Witness so much? I mean, I get her being annoyed by her bc I am too and I dislike her bc she's whiny and irritating but she seems to really hate her :/
[8/7/2014 8:22:31 PM] Deano: She's so annoying jfc like I didn't unfollow her bc G was insecure I unfollowed bc she's annoying as fuck
[8/7/2014 8:22:35 PM] Deano: All her fuckjng ooc posts
[8/7/2014 8:22:45 PM] Deano: I can't stand it when people post ooc all the time
[8/7/2014 8:22:53 PM] Deano: Like get a fuckjng personal for that shit
[8/7/2014 8:24:57 PM] Lucifer: she always bitched on the dash about feeling inadequate; and i've noticed that she's started trying to force purple prose which pissed me off bc i use it and it almost seems like she's trying to badly copy me ??
[8/7/2014 8:26:13 PM] Deano: Whys it called purple prose?
[8/7/2014 8:26:23 PM] Deano: And she probs is ugh
[8/7/2014 8:30:45 PM] Lucifer: idk just elaborate writing ; using big words and elaborate description. idk her writing is reading more like mine now and a week ago it wasn't quite that complex.
[8/7/2014 8:33:27 PM] Deano: Why purple tho xD
[8/7/2014 8:34:17 PM] Deano: Also bleh fuck witness
[8/7/2014 8:34:26 PM] Deano: Idk why g gets herself all worked up about it
[8/7/2014 8:34:35 PM] Deano: Like jfc just seperate yourself from them
[8/7/2014 8:35:16 PM] Lucifer: yeah i know. just unfollow her and forget her existence. she's one person out of the whole of tumblr.
[8/7/2014 8:35:35 PM] Deano: Yep.
[8/7/2014 8:35:44 PM] Deano: But no. G goes and follows people that witness plays with
[8/7/2014 8:35:49 PM] Deano: And then gets butthurt
[8/7/2014 8:38:17 PM] Lucifer: :/ Yeah ; Ikr? Like Idk how many times I have to tell her that her Gabriel is much better than fucking Witness, but she doesn't believe me- Witness is a gd idiot. Ignore her. She's not that great and she only has all the followers that she has bc she follows freaking everybody :/
[8/7/2014 8:40:36 PM] Deano: Yep. Sighs.
[8/7/2014 8:42:34 PM] Lucifer: :(
[8/7/2014 8:42:44 PM] Deano: I hate not being able to help
[8/7/2014 8:42:53 PM] Deano: And then I feel like shit bc she feels like shit
[8/7/2014 8:44:05 PM] Lucifer: I know, same. But nothing we say to her ever helps or sinks in. ;
[8/7/2014 8:44:26 PM] Deano: It's just a shitty situation
[8/7/2014 8:46:44 PM] Lucifer: and i know she feels like shit bc the fandom ignores her and idk why they do. she's brilliant. but i mean- i'm not sure what to do.
[8/7/2014 8:47:05 PM] Lucifer: i just wish i could make her feel better. :/
[8/7/2014 8:49:44 PM] Deano: I don't think they ignore her anymore than they ignore anybody else
[8/7/2014 8:49:53 PM] Deano: I mean I only play with like 4/5 people
[8/7/2014 8:50:00 PM] Deano: But she takes it way personally
[8/7/2014 8:54:01 PM] Lucifer: I know :( she does.
[8/7/2014 8:54:26 PM] Deano: And there's nothing we can say or do to make it better
[8/7/2014 8:54:37 PM] Deano: Plus it makes me feel like I'm not good enough for her
[8/7/2014 8:54:39 PM] Deano: Uvh
[8/7/2014 8:54:42 PM] Deano: Gargles blood
[8/7/2014 8:56:06 PM] Lucifer: I know, same. :/ Because she doesn't believe us, she doesn't try to see what we're saying, and she just gives up and deletes.
[8/7/2014 8:56:19 PM] Deano: Yep.
[8/7/2014 8:57:27 PM] Deano: Vicious cycle
[8/7/2014 8:57:57 PM] Lucifer: it is. and now she's going like that with jake and i'm like 'if you delete jake over this shit, so help me god i will kick your ass' >.>
[8/7/2014 8:58:37 PM] Deano: D :
[8/7/2014 8:58:40 PM] Deano: She is?
[8/7/2014 8:58:49 PM] Deano: She was doing so good with Jake tho
[8/7/2014 9:00:19 PM] Lucifer: She was. :/ Idk, I think it was just her putting herself down- I don't think she's serious about it. But I know that it'll lead to that if she keeps putting herself down.
[8/7/2014 9:00:36 PM] Deano: Gdi
[8/7/2014 9:00:52 PM] Deano: Maybe she just needs to stay away from tumblr for awhile
[8/7/2014 9:02:51 PM] Deano: I've told her a few times if she wants me to delete everything I would in a heartbeat
[8/7/2014 9:05:14 PM] Lucifer: yeah :( she just needs to stop worrying. bc we still love her. i only thread with like four people. we don't need to be popular.
[8/7/2014 9:06:16 PM] Deano: ^^^^that
[8/7/2014 9:06:18 PM] Deano: Ughh
[8/7/2014 9:08:43 PM] Lucifer: I just get so frustrated.
[8/7/2014 9:09:06 PM] Deano: Me too
[8/7/2014 9:13:37 PM] Lucifer: siiiigh
[8/7/2014 9:13:38 PM] Lucifer: D:
[8/7/2014 9:16:32 PM] Deano: ;(
[8/7/2014 9:16:55 PM] Lucifer: I just worry. And I wish she would listen to us bc we wouldn't lie to her.
[8/7/2014 9:17:08 PM] Deano: Yeah I worry too
[8/7/2014 9:17:23 PM] Deano: It especially hurts me bc I'm supposed to be able to help bc girlfriend 😩
[8/7/2014 9:17:35 PM] Lucifer: I'm picky as fuck. If I didn't like how she rp'd her character I would tell her. I would be nice about it, but I would be honest if I spotted something wrong.
[8/7/2014 9:18:09 PM] Deano: Me too. Lol I'm super fucking picky
[8/7/2014 9:18:18 PM] Lucifer: :( I know. And it feels backhanded when she takes our advice but then it comes out that she doesn't believe us anyway.
[8/7/2014 9:19:09 PM] Lucifer: Her Gabriel is amazing and her writing is amazing and if I saw something I thought could be changed or worked with, I would bring it up.
[8/7/2014 9:19:23 PM] Deano: Yep
[8/7/2014 9:19:26 PM] Deano: Sighs
[8/7/2014 9:20:26 PM] Lucifer: :(
[8/7/2014 9:23:48 PM] Lucifer: but idk how to get her to see how great she is
[8/7/2014 9:26:15 PM] Lucifer: bc she won't believe me. and it gets frustrating when i keep having to reassure her.
[8/7/2014 9:28:09 PM] Deano: Same.
[8/7/2014 9:29:00 PM] Lucifer: Her writing is not bad, she's awesome, but she gets down bc she feels inferior and she's not. :(
[8/7/2014 9:31:17 PM] Deano: I know
[8/7/2014 9:38:30 PM] Lucifer: :( what do we do?
[8/7/2014 9:42:48 PM] Deano: I don't know ;(
[8/7/2014 9:42:55 PM] Deano: I don't think there's anything we can do
[8/7/2014 9:47:53 PM] Lucifer: Like I get you have insecurities, but you need to listen to people who tell you differently. I've told her, as an artist, we've inclined to be critical of ourselves---
[8/7/2014 10:06:56 PM] Lucifer: -curls around-
[8/7/2014 10:26:10 PM] Deano: Cuddles

[8/18/2014 9:47:59 PM] Deano: Sorry you had a shitty week bb ;-;
[8/18/2014 9:49:21 PM] Lucifer: Thank you (heart). I bitch more than post on that account, it seems.
[8/18/2014 9:49:58 PM] Lucifer: I mostly get ignored over there anyway.
[8/18/2014 9:50:26 PM] Deano: :(
[8/18/2014 9:51:49 PM] Lucifer: I ask for anons, nobody sends them. Nobody comes running to me when I have a bad day; I do a self-promo and I'm lucky if it gets reblogged once. like idek- I'm just mentally stressed with school, mostly. Usually it doesn't bother me this much. ;
[8/18/2014 9:55:12 PM] Deano: : (
[8/18/2014 10:01:11 PM] Lucifer: I just feel like everything is failling apart.
[8/18/2014 10:02:34 PM] Deano: Rp? or IRL?
[8/18/2014 10:02:38 PM] Lucifer: IRL
[8/18/2014 10:03:17 PM] Lucifer: I feel like I can't do anything right. I feel like a failure.
[8/18/2014 10:04:06 PM] Deano: ;-; School stress?
[8/18/2014 10:04:16 PM] Lucifer: Mostly. :(
[8/18/2014 10:05:19 PM] Deano: I'm sorry I can't do anything to help ;-;
[8/18/2014 10:06:15 PM] Lucifer: I'll live. ;
[8/18/2014 10:20:40 PM] Lucifer: i'm gonna follow your dean on spaceman ; bc i can and i need to finish setting up his blog even though i've already started writing--- oops.
[8/18/2014 10:21:12 PM] Lucifer: i already follow you ;; i must've followed you on bart.
[8/18/2014 10:34:02 PM] Deano: urllll
[8/18/2014 10:34:43 PM] Lucifer: http://prodigalsmartass.tumblr.com
[8/18/2014 10:46:31 PM] Deano: sorry back
[8/18/2014 10:46:32 PM] Deano: still shaking
[8/18/2014 10:46:37 PM] Deano: but worst part of panic is over
[8/18/2014 10:46:44 PM] Lucifer: what's wrong bb?
[8/18/2014 10:46:47 PM] Lucifer: ;n;
[8/18/2014 10:46:56 PM] Deano: my dad outed me to his friend bc they're both drunk
[8/18/2014 10:46:59 PM] Deano: and I had a panic attack
[8/18/2014 10:47:07 PM] Deano: and I couldn't figure out why
[8/18/2014 10:47:10 PM] Deano: and I still don't know why
[8/18/2014 10:47:18 PM] Deano: but I think it's just because I thought I could keep hiding it and I can't
[8/18/2014 10:47:23 PM] Deano: so I'm just gonna fucking gay up this shit
[8/18/2014 10:48:24 PM] Lucifer: (heart) You should be exactly who you want to be bb. ;v; You shouldn't be ashamed of being gay.
[8/18/2014 10:48:58 PM] Deano: I know ;-;
[8/18/2014 10:49:21 PM] Deano: and I thought I wasn't-- and I thought all the bad depression shit about it was over, and then this happened
[8/18/2014 10:49:26 PM] Deano: and I think hiding it has been hurting me
[8/18/2014 10:49:38 PM] Deano: and it's not even that I've been hiding it really just never bringing it up
[8/18/2014 10:50:48 PM] Lucifer: Yeah, I can see that. Repression/supression can make you bitter. Even if you're not technically hiding, you're still hiding a part of yourself pretending to be something that you're not and I think you'll feel a lot better once you can breathe freely.
[8/18/2014 10:52:41 PM] Deano: I hope so (heart)
[8/18/2014 10:53:29 PM] Lucifer: I think it will ;v;
[8/18/2014 11:00:15 PM] Deano: (heart)
[8/18/2014 11:00:43 PM] Lucifer: (heart) once the anxiety wears off, hopefully you'll feel better. ;v;
[8/18/2014 11:01:04 PM] Deano: Sorry to throw all this shit on you when you were having a thing : (
[8/18/2014 11:01:15 PM] Deano: It just came up so suddenly and I had to talk to somebody
[8/18/2014 11:01:39 PM] Lucifer: It's okay. I don't mind listening. ;v;
[8/18/2014 11:02:45 PM] Deano: Now i'm gonna drink this beer and re-start the L word series lol
[8/18/2014 11:02:52 PM] Deano: the first time I tried to watch I only got half way through
[8/18/2014 11:03:34 PM] Lucifer: awwww i have booze hidden under my bed. xD

[8/28/2014 9:49:40 PM] Lucifer: said what? o.O
[8/28/2014 9:50:06 PM] Deano: G figured out that I'm insecure about her replacing me ._.
[8/28/2014 9:50:23 PM] Lucifer: No, I haven't. :/

[8/29/2014 2:02:35 PM] Lucifer: Yeah, I mean. I'd like to remain neutral on that aspect because 1.) I really don't know how your fights start and 2.) you're both my friends and I don't want to take sides. But I know that fights take two to fuel.
[8/29/2014 2:04:11 PM] Deano: Like last night we fought. And I was fucking high I was in a great mood
[8/29/2014 2:04:15 PM] Deano: Ofc I can't tell her that
[8/29/2014 2:04:23 PM] Deano: But she was all you started this and I was like ?????
[8/29/2014 2:05:31 PM] Lucifer: fighting for any friendship is healthy to some degree, but when you fight too much that's when you have problems and you guys seem to fight a lot.... which isn't healthy. it causes a lot of stress to yourselves and each other.
[8/29/2014 2:05:53 PM] Deano: Yeah..
[8/29/2014 2:05:58 PM] Deano: It comes and goes tbh
[8/29/2014 2:06:08 PM] Deano: Like we'll be great then BOOM fighting for a few weeks
[8/29/2014 2:06:12 PM] Deano: Then no fighting at all
[8/29/2014 2:07:16 PM] Deano: And honestly the only reason I've been like even more clingy than usual was because when I worked we couldn't talk much so I was like YAY now we have both time
[8/29/2014 2:07:24 PM] Deano: And then she doesn't really wanna talk much
[8/29/2014 2:07:34 PM] Deano: So I get paranoid that she doesn't need me after that time apart
[8/29/2014 2:07:38 PM] Deano: Because god I need her
[8/29/2014 2:11:03 PM] Lucifer: I don't think it's that. I really think she just needs time to come back around.
[8/29/2014 2:14:24 PM] Deano: I hope.
[8/29/2014 2:42:48 PM] Deano: Distract me
[8/29/2014 2:42:49 PM] Deano: Help
[8/29/2014 2:43:04 PM] Lucifer: -distracts-
[8/29/2014 2:43:20 PM] Lucifer: booze is amazing for distractin'

[8/29/2014 2:44:37 PM] Lucifer: it just takes practice. xP
[8/29/2014 2:56:11 PM] Deano: Lol naw I'll stick to writing lol
[8/29/2014 2:56:20 PM] Deano: I like photography tho uvu
[8/29/2014 3:05:18 PM] Lucifer: my photography is bad. xD
[8/29/2014 3:06:49 PM] Deano: Mine probably is too tbh but I like it LOL
[8/29/2014 3:07:04 PM] Lucifer: I'm sure it's not ;v;
[8/29/2014 3:07:10 PM] Lucifer: if you enjoy it and have a passion
[8/29/2014 3:07:14 PM] Lucifer: you can't go wrong
[8/29/2014 3:07:46 PM] Deano: c:
[8/29/2014 3:51:29 PM] Deano: I'm actually pretty drunk

[8/29/2014 3:53:31 PM] Deano: Propose grammar and everything
[8/29/2014 3:53:43 PM] Deano: Don't tell her cause then she'll be even more pissed
[8/29/2014 3:53:49 PM] Deano: Alonso I'm out of cigs
[8/29/2014 3:54:05 PM] Lucifer: lmfao
[8/29/2014 3:54:14 PM] Lucifer: awwwww are you guys working things out?
[8/29/2014 3:54:22 PM] Deano: Yeah she's still pissed
[8/29/2014 3:54:25 PM] Deano: I'm too clingy
[8/29/2014 3:54:29 PM] Deano: I know I am
[8/29/2014 3:54:45 PM] Deano: I get scared
[8/29/2014 3:55:05 PM] Deano: I threw up
[8/29/2014 3:55:58 PM] Deano: Now I have to pee
[8/29/2014 3:56:02 PM] Lucifer: And it's okay to be scared, but don't let it control you. Log off, do something else, idk- but when you constantly fire up and get on her about things, it's only doing more damage. ;
[8/29/2014 3:57:06 PM] Lucifer: you're not a bad person, you'
[8/29/2014 3:57:12 PM] Lucifer: ve just had bad experiences.
[8/29/2014 3:59:38 PM] Deano: :(
[8/29/2014 4:01:03 PM] Deano: I try not to be bad
[8/29/2014 4:02:24 PM] Lucifer: I know. I didn't realize I was hurting Sam so much until she stopped talking to me for three weeks. And I realized I needed to change, or I was going to lose her. And you don't want that to happen. You don't want to lose G.
[8/29/2014 4:05:22 PM] Lucifer: I was in the same position. She was getting more friends, new rp partners, and i was getting clingy and scared and insecure and I needed constant reminding that she wasn't leaving. It was bad, and I was constantly on her about talking on the dash but ignoring me on skype, got upset if she didn't answer my rps and answered other people. It was a vicious cycle.
[8/29/2014 4:05:44 PM] Deano: That's what I do too..
[8/29/2014 4:05:56 PM] Lucifer: Until it finally came to a head and she just shut down and quit talking to me, ignored my IM's, ignored my messages on Tumblr.
[8/29/2014 4:07:19 PM] Lucifer: Insecurity is a very toxic thing. I didn't realize how bad I was until she was gone, she said she almost cut me out. And I wouldn't have blamed her if she would've.
[8/29/2014 4:07:32 PM] Deano: :(
[8/29/2014 4:08:33 PM] Lucifer: I'm not telling you this to make you feel bad, just to be more aware of what could happen if it isn't curved.
[8/29/2014 4:09:12 PM] Deano: I think I got this way with Kaira although with her it wasn't all paranoi she really did replace me
[8/29/2014 4:09:15 PM] Deano: Stopped replying
[8/29/2014 4:09:23 PM] Deano: Or only gave me two sentences
[8/29/2014 4:09:28 PM] Deano: And others got paragraphs
[8/29/2014 4:09:36 PM] Deano: And when I saw her starter for you I panicked
[8/29/2014 4:11:58 PM] Lucifer: G is also upset right now, which affects muse for certain replies. I know if I'm angry at someone, I usually don't reply to them for awhile because the muse just isn't there. It's not that I don't like them or are replacing them but it's difficult to have motivation for threads when you're currently fighting with the person. And sometimes muse is just fickle. I don't think G would ever replace you. It's not how she is.
[8/29/2014 4:14:55 PM] Deano: I know.
[8/29/2014 4:15:01 PM] Deano: I just got so terrified
[8/29/2014 4:15:12 PM] Lucifer: :(
[8/29/2014 4:15:15 PM] Lucifer: -snugs-
[8/29/2014 4:16:03 PM] Lucifer: I know you did, and when people are scared they handle things irrationally.
[8/29/2014 4:16:28 PM] Deano: It didn't help that it's been weeks of not talking
[8/29/2014 4:16:30 PM] Deano: Because of worj
[8/29/2014 4:16:32 PM] Deano: Worj
[8/29/2014 4:16:35 PM] Deano: Work
[8/29/2014 4:17:01 PM] Lucifer: Yeah, but didn't you guys text and stuff?
[8/29/2014 4:17:21 PM] Deano: A little
[8/29/2014 4:17:23 PM] Deano: Not much
[11/18/2014 4:16:35 PM] Deano: (heart)
[11/18/2014 10:04:37 PM] Deano: Omg I have to pee so bad
[11/27/2014 10:46:23 PM] Deano: I miss you ;(
[11/30/2014 10:14:24 PM] Lucifer: I need more threads on Bill );
[12/2/2014 5:25:43 PM] Lucifer: i haven't had internet for a while so your messages are just coming through

[12/2/2014 10:00:05 PM] Lucifer: like what? what happened? D8
[12/2/2014 10:07:25 PM] Deano: My family dogs got real sick and my dad had to shoot them both and my pet mouse has been sick for a week and today she couldn't move so I had to kill her and I threw up
[12/2/2014 10:07:31 PM] Deano: I don't know how my dad did it.
[12/2/2014 10:08:15 PM] Lucifer: ):
[12/2/2014 10:08:38 PM] Lucifer: yeah that can be hard.... we've had to shoot pets too unfortunately. =/
[12/2/2014 10:08:43 PM] Deano: ;;-;;
[12/2/2014 10:08:55 PM] Lucifer: but it's easier to think of it as an ease of suffering.
[12/2/2014 10:08:57 PM] Deano: I was lucky enough not to be home when the dogs got sick.
[12/2/2014 10:09:05 PM] Deano: I know-- and I understand that it had to be done.
[12/2/2014 10:09:05 PM] Lucifer: a bullet to the head is quick. and they don't feel it.
[12/2/2014 10:09:08 PM] Deano: Just like with Charlie ;;-;;
[12/2/2014 10:09:18 PM] Deano: She was the sweetest little mouse and I just couldn't watch anymore
[12/2/2014 10:09:23 PM] Lucifer: ):
[12/2/2014 10:09:30 PM] Deano: part of me thinks I was being selfish, but I know there was no way she could pull through--
[12/2/2014 10:09:35 PM] Deano: even if she had a couple more days in her
[12/2/2014 10:09:45 PM] Lucifer: did you try taking her to a vet?
[12/2/2014 10:09:55 PM] Deano: She was a $2 mouse ;-;
[12/2/2014 10:10:02 PM] Deano: I loved her, but I can't afford that
[12/2/2014 10:10:28 PM] Deano: She lived a lot happier longer life than she would have. I got her at a bait shop.
[12/2/2014 10:10:42 PM] Deano: and she got to eat a bunch of cheerios yesterday bc I knew it was coming up on the end and those are her favorite
[12/2/2014 10:11:38 PM] Deano: I tried to be Clarke from the 100 but G says I'm Stanley from Jericho
[12/2/2014 10:11:45 PM] Lucifer: yeah :( i think it would have been more selfish to keep her alive. at least she went quick.
[12/2/2014 10:11:59 PM] Lucifer: awwwww well stanley is awesome ;;;
[12/2/2014 10:12:18 PM] Lucifer: i think you made the right choice
[12/2/2014 10:12:32 PM] Deano: Me too ;-; even though I feel disgusting
[12/2/2014 10:12:47 PM] Deano: I don't think I could ever do that again.
[12/2/2014 10:13:56 PM] Lucifer: It's never easy to do that but sometimes it is a necessary evil
[12/2/2014 10:14:22 PM] Lucifer: especially when you know the animal isn't going to recover
[12/2/2014 10:14:52 PM] Deano: I know ;;-;;
[12/2/2014 10:15:06 PM] Deano: She was at the end of her lifespan--
[12/2/2014 10:15:15 PM] Deano: and I just. I couldn't watch anymore.
[12/2/2014 10:15:17 PM] Deano: She couldn't even stand
[12/2/2014 10:15:22 PM] Deano: kept flipping over--
[12/2/2014 10:15:32 PM] Lucifer: how long do they live, three years?
[12/2/2014 10:15:46 PM] Deano: If they're super lucky, and I think that's only specific breeds
[12/2/2014 10:16:17 PM] Lucifer: yeah, might be rats that live three years. i'm not sure about mice. she was old, and it was time ; she was ready to go.
[12/2/2014 10:17:07 PM] Deano: It's funny bc I got her instead of a rat because I didn't want such a long commitment
[12/2/2014 10:17:12 PM] Deano: and now I'm just like god
[12/2/2014 10:17:16 PM] Deano: I hate everything

[12/5/2014 7:51:05 PM] Lucifer: I'm sorry that I'm upset. That I've been waiting patiently for a month, and watching other people get their threads and being told that she would do mine, when she doesn't even have the interest to do them. But I am justified to be hurt and to feel hurt by being thrown on a backburner.
[12/5/2014 7:53:28 PM] Deano: Her last replies were to you?????
[12/5/2014 7:53:55 PM] Lucifer: she's owed me four threads for over a month. our last replies were chats.

[12/5/2014 7:55:28 PM] Deano: You basically called her stupid
[12/5/2014 7:55:41 PM] Lucifer: I didn't post the link to her to be mean.
[12/5/2014 7:55:51 PM] Deano: It seemed really fucking rude.
[12/5/2014 7:55:55 PM] Lucifer: I did it because I found it funny. I had no malicious intent.
[12/5/2014 7:56:01 PM] Deano: It wasn't funny.
[12/5/2014 7:56:23 PM] Deano: Sorry. But. Not cool bro.
[12/5/2014 7:58:53 PM] Lucifer: I didn't think it would offend her bc i send stuff like that a lot and she said she wasn't offended by it, I did apologize to her for it. I didn't think she'd be upset and I felt bad.
[12/5/2014 8:20:08 PM] Deano: I mean I get it bc that stuff can be funny and I'd get it if you meant it about yourself
[12/5/2014 8:20:22 PM] Deano: But the cake said something like sorry I'm so stupid
[12/5/2014 8:20:28 PM] Deano: You called her stupid and ,
[12/5/2014 8:20:34 PM] Deano: Made her feel like shit
[12/5/2014 8:22:28 PM] Lucifer: I didn't call her stupid. And when I realized that it upset her, I apologized, I wasn't calling her stupid. Not purposely anyway, I would never be malicious like that. =/
[12/5/2014 8:38:58 PM] Deano: I know you wouldn't ;-;
[12/5/2014 8:39:06 PM] Deano: Sorry I got worked up.
[12/5/2014 8:39:58 PM] Lucifer: it's fine. i'm not a mean person. i sent it to her bc i saw it on the dash and it made me laugh, i never thought for a second that she would take it as a stab at her.... or i wouldn't have sent it.
[12/5/2014 8:44:04 PM] Lucifer: and we're talking things out now ;
[12/5/2014 8:47:38 PM] Deano: I know ;-;

[12/5/2014 9:53:43 PM] Deano: What did you say?
[12/5/2014 9:54:00 PM] Deano: No I was having dinner
[12/5/2014 9:54:31 PM] Lucifer: It wasn't sending so I deleted it, just stuff about me and G talking stuff out. That I wasn't aware of how much anxiety she was going through and that we're working something out with our threads to lessen her stress.
[12/5/2014 9:55:05 PM] Lucifer: We're dropping a lot of threads and just focusing on the two plotted ones.
[12/5/2014 9:55:59 PM] Lucifer: I feel like a douchenozzle now tho. D8
[12/5/2014 9:57:29 PM] Lucifer: for a minute i thought you blocked me bc nothing going through and you were suddenly appearing offline
[12/6/2014 3:02:30 PM] Deano: I'm really glad you two worked stuff out!
[12/6/2014 3:02:33 PM] Deano: No I wouldn't block you lol
[12/6/2014 3:02:49 PM] Deano: I was just eating a late dinner and then I went to the bar
[12/6/2014 3:20:05 PM] Lucifer: My net was messing up, or rather, my Skype. It does that a lot.
[12/14/2014 7:44:22 PM] Deano: You mad at me?
[12/14/2014 7:45:11 PM] Lucifer: no? why?
[12/14/2014 7:45:19 PM] Deano: Just a feeling
[12/14/2014 7:47:56 PM] Lucifer: I've just been really vacant lately in general. ); it's nobody's fault, so i'm sorry if you feel like i'm upset with you. I promise I'm not.
[12/14/2014 10:20:14 PM] Deano: Sorry Skype sucks + I suck at Skype = disaster
